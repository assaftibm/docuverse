# Small extract from the ClapNQ corpus.

This example is a small sub-sample of the ClapNQ corpus - just 1000 documents plus the relevant documents, together 
with the answerable questions. The corpus can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/primeqa/clapnq and is highly 
recommended.

Note that the performance will be higher than on the entire corpus, as it contains only 1000 documents. When one adds 
all the documents in the corpus, it will result in lower performance, as the system will find (and score higher) 
impostors.
