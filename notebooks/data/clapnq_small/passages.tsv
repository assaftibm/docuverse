827849752_115-357	Egocentrism is the inability to differentiate between self and other . More specifically , it is the inability to untangle subjective schemas from objective reality ; an inability to understand or assume any perspective other than their own .	Egocentrism
827849752_358-743	Although egocentrism and narcissism appear similar , they are not the same . A person who is egocentric believes they are the center of attention , like a narcissist , but does not receive gratification by one 's own admiration . Both egotists and narcissists are people whose egos are greatly influenced by the approval of others , while for egocentrists this may or may not be true .	Egocentrism
827849752_744-1186	Although egocentric behaviors are less prominent in adulthood , the existence of some forms of egocentrism in adulthood indicates that overcoming egocentrism may be a lifelong development that never achieves completion . Adults appear to be less egocentric than children because they are faster to correct from an initially egocentric perspective than children , not because they are less likely to initially adopt an egocentric perspective .	Egocentrism
827849752_1187-1426	Therefore , egocentrism is found across the life span : in infancy early childhood , adolescence , and adulthood . It contributes to the human cognitive development by helping children develop theory of mind and self - identity formation .	Egocentrism
827849752_1604-3189	The main concept infants and young children learn by beginning to show egocentrism is the fact that their thoughts , values , and behaviors are different from those of others , also known as the theory of mind . Initially when children begin to have social interactions with others , mainly the caregivers , they misinterpret that they are one entity , because they are together for a long duration of time and the caregivers often provide for the children 's needs . For example , a child may misattribute the act of their mother reaching to retrieve an object that they point to as a sign that they are the same entity , when in fact they are actually separate individuals . As early as 15 months old , children show a mix of egocentrism and theory of mind when an agent acts inconsistently with how the children expect him to behave . In this study the children observed the experimenter place a toy inside one of two boxes , but did not see when the experimenter removed the toy from the original box and placed it in the other box , due to obstruction by a screen . When the screen was removed the children watched the experimenter reach to take the toy out of one of the boxes , yet because the children did not see the switching part , they looked at the experimenter 's action much longer when she reached for the box opposite to the one she originally put the toy in . Not only does this show the existence of infants ' memory capacity , but it also demonstrates how they have expectations based on their knowledge , as they are surprised when those expectations are not met .	Egocentrism
827849752_3216-3501	According to George Butterworth and Margaret Harris , during childhood , one is usually unable to distinguish between what is subjective and objective . According to Piaget , `` an egocentric child assumes that other people see , hear , and feel exactly the same as the child does . ''	Egocentrism
827849752_3502-4638	Jean Piaget ( 1896 -- 1980 ) developed a theory about the development of human intelligence , describing the stages of cognitive development . He claimed that early childhood is the time of pre-operational thought , characterized by children 's inability to process logical thought . According to Piaget , one of the main obstacles to logic that children possess includes centration , `` the tendency to focus on one aspect of a situation to the exclusion of others . '' A particular type of centration is egocentrism -- literally , `` self - centeredness . '' Piaget claimed that young children are egocentric , capable of contemplating the world only from their personal perspective . For example , a three - year - old presented his mother a model truck as her birthday present ; `` he had carefully wrapped the present and gave it to his mother with an expression that clearly showed he expected her to love it . '' The three - year - old boy had not chosen the present out of selfishness or greediness , but he simply failed to realize that , from his mother 's perspective , she might not enjoy the model car as much as he would .	Egocentrism
827849752_4639-5580	Piaget was concerned with two aspects of egocentricity in children : language and morality . He believed that egocentric children use language primarily for communication with oneself . Piaget observed that children would talk to themselves during play , and this egocentric speech was merely the child 's thoughts . He believed that this speech had no special function ; it was used as a way of accompanying and reinforcing the child 's current activity . He theorized that as the child matures cognitively and socially the amount of egocentric speech used would be reduced . However , Vygotsky felt that egocentric speech has more meaning , as it allows the child 's growth in social speech and high mental development . In addition to Piaget 's theory , he believed that when communicating with others , the child believes that others know everything about the topic of discussion and become frustrated when asked to give further detail .	Egocentrism
827849752_5581-6181	Piaget also believed that egocentrism affects the child 's sense of morality . Due to egocentrism , the child is only concerned with the final outcome of an event rather than another 's intentions . For example , if someone breaks the child 's toy , the child would not forgive the other and the child would n't be able to understand that the person who broke the toy did not intend to break it . This phenomenon can also be backed by the evidence from the findings of the case study by Nelson , who studied the use of motives and outcomes by young children as aiding to form their moral judgements .	Egocentrism
827849752_6182-7476	Piaget did a test to investigate egocentrism called the mountains study . He put children in front of a simple plaster mountain range and then asked them to pick from four pictures the view that he , Piaget , would see . The younger children before age seven picked the picture of the view they themselves saw and were therefore found to lack the ability to appreciate a viewpoint different from their own . In other words , their way of reasoning was egocentric . Only when entering the concrete - operational stage of development at age seven to twelve , children became less egocentric and could appreciate viewpoints other than their own . In other words , they were capable of cognitive perspective - taking . However , the mountains test has been criticized for judging only the child 's visuo - spatial awareness , rather than egocentrism . A follow up study involving police dolls showed that even young children were able to correctly say what the interviewer would see . It is thought that Piaget overestimated the extent of egocentrism in children . Egocentrism is thus the child 's inability to see other people 's viewpoints , not to be confused with selfishness . The child at this stage of cognitive development assumes that their view of the world is the same as other peoples .	Egocentrism
827849752_7477-8605	In addition , a more well - known experiment by Wimmer and Perner ( 1983 ) called the false - belief task demonstrates how children show their acquisition of theory of mind ( ToM ) as early as 4 years old . In this task , children see a scenario where one character hides a marble in a basket , walks out of the scene , and another character that is present takes out the marble and put it in a box . Knowing that the first character did not see the switching task , children were asked to predict where the first character would look to find the marble . The results show that children younger than 4 answer that the character would look inside the box , because they have the superior knowledge of where the marble actually is . It shows egocentric thinking in early childhood because they thought that even if the character itself did not see the entire scenario , it has the same amount of knowledge as oneself and therefore should look inside the box to find the marble . As children start to acquire ToM , their ability to recognize and process others ' beliefs and values overrides the natural tendency to be egocentric .	Egocentrism
827849752_8634-9609	Although most of the research completed on the study of egocentrism is primarily focused on early childhood development , it has been found to also occur during adolescence . David Elkind was one of the first to discover the presence of egocentrism in adolescence and late adolescence . He argues , `` the young adolescent , because of the physiological metamorphosis he is undergoing , is primarily concerned with himself . Accordingly , since he fails to differentiate between what others are thinking about and his own mental preoccupations , he assumes that other people are obsessed with his behavior and appearance as he is himself . '' This shows that the adolescent is exhibiting egocentrism , by struggling to distinguish whether or not , in actuality , others are as fond of them as they might think because their own thoughts are so prevalent . Adolescents consider themselves as `` unique , special , and much more socially significant than they actually are . ''	Egocentrism
827849752_9610-10621	Elkind also created terms to help describe the egocentric behaviors exhibited by the adolescent population such as what he calls an imaginary audience , the personal fable , and the invincibility fable . Usually when an egocentric adolescent is experiencing an imaginary audience , it entails the belief that there is an audience captivated and constantly present to an extent of being overly interested about the egocentric individual . Personal fable refers to the idea that many teenagers believe their thoughts , feelings , and experiences are unique and more extreme than anyone else 's . In the invincibility fable , the adolescent believes in the idea that he or she is immune to misfortune and can not be harmed by things that might defeat a normal person . Egocentrism in adolescence is often viewed as a negative aspect of their thinking ability because adolescents become consumed with themselves and are unable to effectively function in society due to their skewed version of reality and cynicism .	Egocentrism
827849752_10695-11194	Adolescents are often faced with new social environments ( for example , starting secondary school ) which require the adolescent to protect the self which may lead to egocentrism . Development of the adolescent 's identity may lead to the individual experiencing high levels of uniqueness which subsequently becomes egocentric -- this manifests as the personal fable . Parental rejection may lead to the adolescents experiencing high levels of self - consciousness , which can lead to egocentrism .	Egocentrism
827849752_11195-11706	A study was completed on 163 undergraduate students to examine the adolescent egocentrism in college students . Students were asked to complete a self - report questionnaire to determine the level of egocentrism present . The questions simply asked for the reactions that students had to seemingly embarrassing situations . It was found that adolescent egocentrism was more prevalent in the female population than the male . This again exemplifies the idea that egocentrism is present in even late adolescence .	Egocentrism
827849752_11707-12227	Results from other studies have come to the conclusion that egocentrism does not present itself in some of the same patterns as it was found originally . More recent studies have found that egocentrism is prevalent in later years of development unlike Piaget 's original findings that suggested that egocentrism is only present in early childhood development . Egocentrism is especially dominant in early adolescence , particularly when adolescents encounter new environments , such as a new school or a new peer group .	Egocentrism
827849752_12228-12549	In addition , throughout adolescence egocentrism contribute to the development of self - identity ; in order to achieve self - identity , adolescents go through different pathways of `` crisis '' and `` commitment '' stages , and higher self - identity achievement was found to be correlated with heightened egocentrism .	Egocentrism
827849752_12576-12851	The prevalence of egocentrism in the individual has been found to decrease between the ages of 15 and 16 . However , adults are also susceptible to be egocentric or to have reactions or behaviours that can be categorized as egocentric ( Tesch , Whitbourne & Nehrke , 1978 ) .	Egocentrism
827849752_12852-13128	Frankenberger tested adolescents ( 14 -- 18 years old ) and adults ( 20 -- 89 ) on their levels of egocentrism and self - consciousness . It was found that egocentric tendencies had extended to early adulthood and these tendencies were also present in the middle adult years .	Egocentrism
827849752_13129-13414	Baron and Hanna looked at 152 participants and tested to see how the presence of depression affected egocentrism . They tested adults between the ages of 18 and 25 and found that the participants who suffered from depression showed higher levels of egocentrism than those who did not .	Egocentrism
827849752_13415-14424	Finally , Surtees and Apperly found that when adults were asked to judge the number of dots they see and the number of dots the avatar in the computer simulation sees , the presence of the avatar interfered with the participants ' judgment - making during the trials . Specifically , these were the trials where the number of dots seen by the participant was inconsistent from the number of dots the avatar saw . Such effect on the participants diminished when the avatar was replaced with a simple yellow or blue line , which concluded that somehow the avatar having a personal attribute implicitly caused the participants to include its `` vision '' into their own decision making . That said , they made more errors when they saw prompts such as `` the avatar sees N '' when N was the number of dots the participant saw and not the avatar , which shows that egocentric thought is still predominant in making quick judgments , even if the adults are well aware that their thoughts could differ from others .	Egocentrism
811080430_70-451	Retail design is a creative and commercial discipline that combines several different areas of expertise together in the design and construction of retail space . Retail design is primarily a specialized practice of architecture and interior design , however it also incorporates elements of interior decoration , industrial design , graphic design , ergonomics , and advertising .	Retail design
811080430_452-1263	Retail design is a very specialized discipline due to the heavy demands placed on retail space . Because the primary purpose of retail space is to stock and sell product to consumers , the spaces must be designed in a way that promotes an enjoyable and hassle - free shopping experience for the consumer . For example , research shows that male and female shoppers who were accidentally touched from behind by other shoppers left a store earlier than people who had not been touched and evaluated brands more negatively . The space must be specially - tailored to the kind of product being sold in that space ; for example , a bookstore requires many large shelving units to accommodate small products that can be arranged categorically while a clothing store requires more open space to fully display product .	Retail design
811080430_1264-1640	Retail spaces , especially when they form part of a retail chain , must also be designed to draw people into the space to shop . The storefront must act as a billboard for the store , often employing large display windows that allow shoppers to see into the space and the product inside . In the case of a retail chain , the individual spaces must be unified in their design .	Retail design
811080430_1781-2100	Retail design first began to grow in the middle of the 19th century , with stores such as Bon Marche and Printemps in Paris , `` followed by Marshall Fields in Chicago , Selfridges in London and Macy 's in New York . '' These early retail design stores were swiftly continued with an innovation called the chain store .	Retail design
811080430_2101-2759	The first known chain department stores were established in Belgium in 1875 , when Isidore , Benjamin and Modeste Dewachter incorporated Dewachter frères ( Dewachter Brothers ) selling ready - to - wear clothing for men and children and specialty clothing such as riding apparel and beachwear . The firm opened with four locations and , by 1904 , Maison Dewachter ( House of Dewachter ) had stores in 20 cities and towns in Belgium and France , with multiple stores in some cities . Isidore 's eldest son , Louis Dewachter , managed the chain at its peak and also became an internationally known landscape artist , painting under the pseudonym Louis Dewis .	Retail design
811080430_2760-3511	The first retail chain store in the United States was opened in the early 20th century by Frank Winfield Woolworth , which quickly became a franchise across the US . Other chain stores began growing in places like the UK a decade or so later , with stores like Boots . After World War II , a new type of retail design building known as the shopping centre came into being . This type of building took two different paths in comparison between the US and Europe . Shopping centres began being built out of town within the United States to benefit the suburban family , while Europe began putting shopping centres in the middle of town . The first shopping centre in the Netherlands was built in the 1950s , as retail design ideas began spreading east .	Retail design
811080430_3512-4307	The next evolution of retail design was the creation of the boutique in the 1960s , which emphasized retail design run by individuals . Some of the earliest examples of boutiques are the Biba boutique created by Barbara Hulanicki and the Habitat line of stores made by Terence Conran . The rise of the boutique was followed , in the next two decades , with an overall increase in consumer spending across the developed world . This rise made retail design shift to compensate for increased customers and alternative focuses . Many retail design stores redesigned themselves over the period to keep up with changing consumer tastes . These changes resulted on one side with the creation of multiple `` expensive , one - off designer shops '' catering to specific fashion designers and retailers .	Retail design
811080430_4308-4666	The rise of the internet and internet retailing in the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century saw another change in retail design to compensate . Many different sectors not related to the internet reached out to retail design and its practices to lure online shoppers back to physical shops , where retail design can be properly utilized .	Retail design
811080430_4696-5304	A retail designer must create a thematic experience for the consumer , by using spatial cues to entertain as well as entice the consumer to purchase goods and interact with the space . The success of their designs are not measured by design critics but rather the records of the store which compare amount of foot traffic against the overall productivity . Retail designers have an acute awareness that the store and their designs are the background to the merchandise and are only there to represent and create the best possible environment in which to reflect the merchandise to the target consumer group .	Retail design
811080430_5330-6059	Since the evolution of retail design and its impact on productivity have become clear , a series of standardisations in the techniques and design qualities has been determined . These standardisations range from alterations to the perspective of the structure of the space , entrances , circulation systems , atmospheric qualities ( light and sound ) and materiality . By exploring these standardisations in retail design the consumer will be given a thematic experience that entices them to purchase the merchandise . It is also important to acknowledge that a retail space must combine both permanent and non permanent features , that allow it to change as the needs of the consumer and merchandise change ( e.g. per season ) .	Retail design
811080430_6060-6935	The structure of retail space creates the constraints of the overall design ; often the spaces already exist , and have had many prior uses . It is at this stage that logistics must be determined , structural features like columns , stairways , ceiling height , windows and emergency exists all must be factored into the final design . In retail one hundred percent of the space must be utilised and have a purpose . The floor plan creates the circulation which then directly controls the direction of the traffic flow based on the studied psychology of consumer movement pattern within a retail space . Circulation is important because it ensures that the consumer moves through the store from front to back , guiding them to important displays and in the end to the cashier . There are six basic store layouts and circulation plans that all provide a different experience :	Retail design
811080430_6936-8506	Straight plan : this plan divides transitional areas from one part of the store to the other by using walls to display merchandise . It also leads the consumer to the back of the store . This design can be used for a variety of stores ranging from pharmacies to apparel . Pathway plan : is most suitable for large stores that are single level . In this plan there is a path that is unobstructed by shop fixtures , this smoothly guides the consumer through to the back of the store . This is well suited for apparel department stores , as the clothes will be easily accessible . Diagonal plan : uses perimeter design which cause angular traffic flow . The cashier is in a central location and easily accessible . This plan is most suited for self - service retail . Curved plan : aims to create an intimate environment that is inviting . In this plan there is an emphasis on the structure of the space including the walls , corners and ceiling this is achieved by making the structure curved and is enhance by circular floor fixtures . Although this is a more expensive layout it is more suited to smaller spaces like salons and boutiques . Varied plan : in this plan attention is drawn to special focus areas , as well as having storage areas that line the wall . This is best suited for footwear and jewellery retail stores . Geometric plan : uses the racks and the retail floor fixtures to create a geometric floor plan and circulation movement . By lowering parts of the ceiling certain areas can create defined retail spaces . This is well suited for appeal stores .	Retail design
811080430_8507-8840	Once the overall structure and circulation of the space has been determined , the atmosphere and thematics of the space must be created through lighting , sound , materials and visual branding . These design elements will cohesively have the greatest impact on the consumer and thus the level of productivity that could be achieved .	Retail design
811080430_8841-10127	Lighting can have a dramatic impact on the space . It needs to be functional but also complement the merchandise as well as emphasize key points throughout the store . The lighting should be layered and of a variety of intensities and fixtures . Firstly , examine the natural light and what impact it has in the space . Natural light adds interest and clarity to the space ; also consumers also prefer to examine the quality of merchandise in natural light . If no natural light exists , a sky light can be used to introduce it to the retail space . The lighting of the ceiling and roof is the next thing to consider . This lighting should wash the structural features while creating vectors that direct the consumer to key merchandise selling areas . The next layer should emphasize the selling areas . These lights should be direct but not too bright and harsh . Poor lighting can cause eye strain and an uncomfortable experience for the consumer . To minimize the possibility of eye strain , the ratio of luminance should decrease between merchandise selling areas . The next layer will complement and bring focus onto the merchandise ; this lighting should be flattering for the merchandise and consumer . The final layer is to install functional lighting such as clear exit signs .	Retail design
811080430_10128-10537	Ambiance can then be developed within the atmosphere through sound and audio , the music played within the store should reflect what your target market would be drawn to , this would also be developed through the merchandise that is being marketed . In a lingerie store the music should be soft , feminine and romanticized ; where in a technology department the music would be more upbeat and more masculine .	Retail design
811080430_10538-11614	Materiality is another key selling tool , the choices made must not only be aesthetically pleasing and persuasive but also functional with a minimal need for maintenance . Retail spaces are high traffic area and are thus exposed to a lot of wear this means that possible finishes of the materials should be durable . The warmth of a material will make the space more inviting , a floor that is firm and somewhat buoyant will be more comfortable for that consumer to walk on and thus this will allow them to take longer when exploring the store . By switching materials throughout the store zones / areas can be defined , for example by making the path one material and contrast it against another for the selling areas this help to guide the consumer through the store . Colour is also important to consider it must not over power or clash against the merchandise but rather create a complementary background for the merchandise . As merchandise will change seasonally the interior colours should not be trend based but rather have timeless appeal like neutral based colours .	Retail design
811080430_11615-12323	Visual branding of the store will ensure a memorable experience for the consumer to take with them once they leave the store ensuring that they will want to return . The key factor is consistency exterior branding and signage should continue into the interior , they should attract , stimulate and dramatise the store . To ensure consistency the font should be consistent with the font size altering . The interior branding should allow the consumer to easily self direct themselves through the store , proper placement of sales signs that will draw consumer in and show exactly where the cashier is located . The branding should reflect what the merchandise is and what the target market would be drawn to .	Retail design
811080430_12345-12667	The final element of a well - executed retail space is the staging of the consumer 's perspective . It is the role of retail design to have total control of the view that the consumer will have of the retail space . From the exterior of a retail store the consumer should have a clear unobstructed view into the interior .	Retail design
802819300_110-367	Oh , Kay ! 1955 Studio Cast Recording Music George Gershwin Lyrics Ira Gershwin Book Guy Bolton P.G. Wodehouse Basis play La Presidente Productions 1926 Broadway 1927 West End 1928 Broadway revival 1928 Film 1960 Off - Broadway revival 1990 Broadway revival	Oh, Kay!
802819300_368-981	Oh , Kay ! is a musical with music by George Gershwin , lyrics by Ira Gershwin , and a book by Guy Bolton and P.G. Wodehouse . It is based on the play La Presidente by Maurice Hanniquin and Pierre Veber . The plot revolves around the adventures of the Duke of Durham and his sister , Lady Kay , English bootleggers in Prohibition Era America . Kay finds herself falling in love with a man who seems unavailable . Oh Kay ! was named for Kay Swift , and the leading male character , Jimmy , is named after her husband , Jimmy Warburg . The show is remembered for its enduring song , `` Someone to Watch Over Me '' .	Oh, Kay!
802819300_982-1226	The musical opened on Broadway in 1926 , starring Gertrude Lawrence and Victor Moore , and ran for 256 performances . The musical then opened in London 's West End in 1927 , starring Lawrence and John Kirby , where it ran for 213 performances .	Oh, Kay!
802819300_1420-2511	Producers Alex A. Aarons and Vinton Freedly imagined Oh , Kay ! as a Princess Theatre - style show , with a contemporary setting , simple sets , and a farcical story . Gertrude Lawrence , who had been featured in the André Charlot revues of 1924 and 1925 , was chosen as the star before the songs or story had been written . In accordance with the typical creative process for early American musicals , George and Ira Gershwin wrote the score to Oh , Kay ! before the librettists , Bolton and Wodehouse , began work on the book . When the book was completed , eight songs from the Gershwins ' score were cut because they could not be easily inserted into the libretto . The show 's Philadelphia previews ran more than three hours , and so the producers cut the prologue ( where the leading lady was introduced ) , thus losing the first 4 songs , and also the Act II `` Finaletto '' , which became obsolete in the reshuffling . This highlighted the farcical elements of the plot at the expense of the romantic ones , since the title character does not appear until 40 minutes into the show .	Oh, Kay!
802819300_2512-2991	The story aptly captured the spirit of the Roaring Twenties , featuring settings and characters familiar to theatre audiences : a decadent Long Island mansion and notorious ( but comic ) bootleggers . During rehearsals , George Gershwin purchased a rag doll in a Philadelphia toy store . The ballad , `` Someone to Watch Over Me '' , was staged with Lawrence alone on stage , clutching the doll and singing to it . It was the hit song of the show and became a Gershwin standard .	Oh, Kay!
802819300_3025-3877	It is 1926 , the Jazz Age and the era of Prohibition . Jimmy Winter is very popular among the young ladies , and they are cleaning the living room of his Long Island , New York , estate , declaring that `` The Woman 's Touch '' is exactly what his home needs . Jimmy has been away but is coming home that evening . In his absence , some English bootleggers , the Duke of Durham , his sister , Lady Kay , and their thick - headed American assistants , `` Shorty '' McGee and Larry Potter , have stashed their illegal booze in Jimmy 's house . When they hear that Jimmy is returning , the Duke cancels that night 's rum run and plans to remove their hundreds of cases of liquor from the cellar . Dolly and Phyllis Ruxton , two of the young ladies , happen to be identical twins . They join Larry in an extemporaneous song and dance ( `` Do n't Ask '' ) .	Oh, Kay!
802819300_3878-4443	Revenue Officer Jansen arrives , convinced that a crime is in progress , but departs when Jimmy returns home . Jimmy is accompanied by his serious and overbearing second wife , Constance , to whom he has just been married . His first marriage followed a drunken college prank , and the couple has now been separated for many years . He applied for an annulment so he could marry Constance . Shorty passes himself off as the new butler , having sent away the butler and maid that Jimmy had ordered . As butler , Shorty can make sure the rum in the basement is safe .	Oh, Kay!
802819300_4444-5518	Jimmy receives a telegram from his lawyer saying that the annulment has not been completed , so Jimmy and Constance are illegally married . Constance furiously leaves for the nearest inn . Jimmy tells Shorty about a beautiful girl who saved him from drowning last summer . He is interrupted when the young ladies who cleaned his house return to welcome him home . He declares that each is a `` Dear Little Girl '' . They leave , and Jimmy prepares for bed as a storm rages outside . Lady Kay , clad in oilskin and clutching a revolver , enters pursued by revenue officers . She turns out to be the girl who rescued Jimmy the previous summer . Jimmy hides her in his bedroom when Officer Jansen arrives at the house to question Jimmy . Jansen leaves but then returns and sees Kay and Jimmy together . Kay says she is Jimmy 's wife , and since the just - married suitcases are still scattered around the living room , the revenue officer believes her and leaves . Kay can not go out in the terrible storm , so she will have to stay the night in Jimmy 's room ( `` Maybe '' ) .	Oh, Kay!
802819300_5519-6379	The Duke and Larry arrive at Jimmy 's house the next morning searching frantically for Kay . The pretty girls also drop in , and Larry leads a minstrel - style song and dance ( `` Clap Yo ' Hands '' ) to cheer up the Duke . Kay hides in Jimmy 's bedroom until all the guests leave . The revenue officer returns , and Jimmy and Kay pretend to be newlyweds ( `` Do , Do , Do '' ) . The Duke , Constance and Constance 's father , Judge Appleton , all show up , and Kay hides in the bedroom again . Now that Jimmy 's annulment is final , the Judge plans to preside over an official marriage ceremony that afternoon . Constance hears noises from the bedroom and opens the door . Kay , now dressed as an English maid , introduces herself as Jane , wife of Shorty the butler . Kay realizes she is in love with Jimmy and resolves to prevent his marriage to Constance .	Oh, Kay!
802819300_6396-7198	Wedding photographs of the `` Bride and Groom '' are being taken , and Kay , still disguised as a maid , tries to convince Jimmy that she would be a better wife than fussy Constance . She tells her rag doll that she needs `` Someone to Watch Over Me '' . Larry is supposed to be ferrying the booze out of the cellar , but he ends up demonstrating the dancing ability of his `` Fidgety Feet '' instead . The revenue officer shows up briefly and is confused when Kay is introduced as Shorty 's wife , not Jimmy 's wife . The Judge and Constance demand lunch , and Shorty and Kay must serve them . The meal becomes increasingly chaotic , and the Judge and Constance are severely offended and leave .

835727589_1253-1842	Bothrops asper is a highly venomous pit viper species ranging from southern Mexico to northern South America and is considered to be one of the most dangerous snakes in the central hemisphere . Sometimes referred to as the `` ultimate pit viper '' , these snakes are found in a wide range of lowland habitats , often near human habitations . Its proximity to human habitations and temperament are likely the reasons why it is considered more dangerous to humans than others . This species is the main cause of snakebite incidents within its range . No subspecies are currently recognized .	Bothrops asper
835727589_2067-2437	The generic name , Bothrops , comes from the Greek words bothros and ops , which mean `` pit '' and `` face '' ( or `` eye '' ) , respectively . This is a reference to these snakes ' highly sensitive heat - detecting pit organs . The specific epithet , asper , which is a Latin word meaning `` rough '' or `` harsh '' , may allude to the species ' keeled dorsal scales .	Bothrops asper
835727589_2460-2852	Some of the common names applied to this snake are terciopelo , fer - de-lance , Mapepire balsain ( Trinidad ) , barba amarilla ( Guatemala , Honduras ; `` yellow beard '' ) , equis ( Ecuador & Panama ; `` x '' ) , taya equis ( Colombia ) , cuaima ( Venezuela ) , nauyaca ( México ; from Nahuatl nahui , four , and yacatl , nose ; `` four noses '' ) , and yellow - jaw tommygoff ( Belize ) .	Bothrops asper
835727589_2853-3178	The name fer - de-lance is commonly used in North America to refer to this species , as well as to B. atrox , although B. atrox is more commonly referred to as the `` lancehead '' in North America . The name fer - de-lance is not used in the countries inhabited by this species . The name terciopelo means velvet in Spanish .	Bothrops asper
835727589_3218-4448	Bothrops species can be distinguished by their broad , flattened heads which are set apart from the rest of their bodies . The head of this snake is light to dark brown or even black . Although usually absent , it may have occipital blotches or streaks that range from indistinct to distinct . The underside is most often pale yellow . This species has different patterns and colors on its dorsal and ventral sides and it exhibits a postorbital stripe . The ventral side is yellow , cream , or a whitish gray , with dark blotches that are more frequent closer to the posterior end . Ventrolaterally , B. asper has interchanging gray scales which are more pale towards the medial line . Dark triangles with pale edges can be seen laterally , which range in number from 18 to 25 . Apices either alternate or are reflective of each other over the middorsal line . In the interspaces , there are dark , paravertebral blotches . Specimens may have a yellow zig - zag - shaped line on each side of the body . There is a great variety of colours on its dorsal side : olive , gray , light brown to dark brown , tan or sometimes nearly black . To prevent water loss where they occur in drier regions , this species has more scales . Colied	Bothrops asper
835727589_4470-5095	Specimens of this species may weigh up to 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) and are often 1.2 to 1.8 meters ( 3.9 to 5.9 ft ) in length . Very big females can reach lengths up to 2.5 metres ( 8.2 ft ) , although this is uncommon . These are among the most sexually dimorphic of all snakes . The two sexes are born the same size , but by age 7 to 12 months , females begin to grow at a much faster rate than males . Females have thick , heavy bodies and grow significantly larger than males . They also have heads two or three times the size of males relative to their size and proportionally bigger fangs ( typically 2.5 cm ) , as well .	Bothrops asper
835727589_5096-5381	Across its geographic range , this species varies greatly phenotypically . As a result , great confusion between it and other related species , most notably Bothrops atrox , which is similar in color but usually has yellow or rust - like tones and rectangular or trapezoidal blotches .	Bothrops asper
835727589_5404-5819	It is found in the Atlantic lowlands of eastern Mexico and Central America , including Guatemala , Belize , Honduras , Nicaragua , Costa Rica and Panama . An isolated population occurs in southeastern Chiapas ( Mexico ) and southwestern Guatemala . In northern South America , it is found in Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana and Venezuela . The type locality given is `` Obispo , on the Isthmus of Darien '' ( Panama ) .	Bothrops asper
835727589_5820-6186	This is mostly a lowland species that , in Mexico and Central America , occurs from about sea level to 1,200 to 1,300 meters ( 3,900 to 4,300 ft ) altitude . In South America , it apparently ranges to considerably higher elevations : up to 2,500 metres ( 8,200 ft ) in Venezuela and at least 2,640 metres ( 8,660 ft ) in Colombia according to herpetologist Lancini .	Bothrops asper
835727589_6187-6753	According to Campbell and Lamar ( 2004 ) , its range in Ecuador extends as far south along the Pacific coast as El Oro Province and the Vilcabamba area of the Río Catamayo Valley . This species is reported to occur from seven ( Bolívar , Carchi , Chimborazo , Esmeraldas , Guayas , Los Ríos and Pichincha ) of the fourteen provinces along the Pacific slope of Ecuador . There are even a few records from northern coastal Peru , with these snakes being reported in the Tumbes Region . It is also known from the island of Gorgona off the Pacific coast of Colombia .	Bothrops asper
835727589_6754-7150	B. asper occurs throughout the inter-Andes valleys of Colombia across the Caribbean coastal plain through central Venezuela north of the Orinoco as far east as the Delta Amacuro region . This is the only Bothrops species that occurs on the island of Trinidad , although the situation there is complicated due to proximity of Trinidad to the Orinoco Delta where it may be sympatric with B. atrox .	Bothrops asper
835727589_7215-7972	This species likes moist environments , and occurs in most life zones located at low or middle elevations ( up to 600 metres ( 2,000 ft ) ) , excluding those with strong seasonal dry periods . They are , however , sometimes found at much higher elevations . This is true in the premontane forest in Costa Rica , the cloud forest of Guatemala and Mexico , or the lower montane wet forest in the Caribbean Region of Colombia and Ecuador . It chiefly inhabits tropical rainforest and evergreen forest , but it also occurs in drier areas of tropical deciduous forest , thorn forest and pine savannah near lakes , rivers and streams . The home range of B. asper averages between 3.71 ha and 5.95 ha , which is comparatively small in relation to other pitvipers .	Bothrops asper
835727589_8009-8780	This species is nocturnal and solitary . It is less active in colder and drier periods . B. asper is often found near rivers and streams , basking under the sun during the day and lying still while well camouflaged in leaf litter or under forest cover waiting to ambush prey ( including rats and mice ) that comes within range during the night . When cornered or threatened , this species can be very defensive and may exhibit an S - coiled defense display . Juveniles are often semiarboreal and even adults are sometimes encountered in bushes and low trees . Juveniles are also known to exhibit caudal luring , a use of their differently colored tail tips to lure prey . Although both males and females display this behavior , only males have bright coloured tail tips .	Bothrops asper
835727589_8781-9291	Compared to the common lancehead , B. atrox , these snakes have been described as excitable and unpredictable when disturbed . They can , and often will , move very quickly , usually opting to flee from danger , but are capable of suddenly reversing direction to vigorously defend themselves . Adult specimens , when cornered and fully alert , should be considered dangerous . In a review of bites from this species suffered by field biologists , Hardy ( 1994 ) referred to it as the `` ultimate pit viper '' .	Bothrops asper
835727589_9401-10677	The timing of the reproductive cycle and the litter size of this species vary according to location : in some parts of Costa Rica , for example , it is more prolific than in others . Reproduction is highly seasonal and in Costa Rica , reproductive cycles are tightly related to rainfall patterns . The timing of breeding differs between populations in the Caribbean and Pacific lowlands . On the Pacific side , mating took place between September and November , with females giving birth between April and June . The average number of offspring was 18.6 ( five to 40 ) in this population . Neonates ranged in total length from 28 to 34.6 centimeters ( 11.0 to 13.6 in ) and in weight from 6.7 to 13.1 grams ( 0.24 to 0.46 oz ) . On the Atlantic side , mating was observed in March , and births occurred between September and November . The average number of offspring was 41.1 ( 14 -- 86 ) , whereas the total length of neonates ranged from 27 to 36.5 centimeters ( 10.6 to 14.4 in ) , and weighed from 6.1 to 20.2 grams ( 0.22 to 0.71 oz ) . In both populations , gestation time ranged from six to eight months , and the size of a litter correlated significantly with the size of the female . This species is considered to be the most prolific of all snakes in the Americas .	Bothrops asper
835727589_10678-11045	Male - male combat in this species has not been observed . Females will mate with more than one male during mating season . Mating includes a series of movements of the male , which then slowly chases an accepting female . The female then stops movement and extends her posture to mate . It is not known whether this species exhibits annual or biannual reproduction .	Bothrops asper
835727589_11331-11491	This species is an important cause of snakebite within its range . Together with Crotalus durissus , it is the leading cause of snakebite in Yucatán , Mexico .	Bothrops asper
835727589_11492-12045	It is considered the most dangerous snake in Costa Rica , responsible for 46 % of all bites and 30 % of all hospitalized cases ; before 1947 , the fatality rate was 9 % , but this has since declined to almost 0 % ( Bolaños , 1984 ) , mostly due to the Clodomiro Picado Research Institute , responsible for the production of snake antiophidic sera ( which are also exported to other Latin American and African countries ) and scientific research on serpents and their venoms , as well as educational and extension programs in rural areas and hospitals .	Bothrops asper
835727589_12046-12217	In the Colombian states of Antioquia and Chocó , it causes 50 -- 70 % of all snakebites , with a sequelae rate of 9 % and a fatality rate of 6 % ( Otero et al. , 1992 ) .	Bothrops asper
835727589_12218-12515	In the state of Lara , Venezuela , it is responsible for 78 % of all envenomations and all snakebite fatalities ( Dao - L. , 1971 ) . One of the reasons so many people are bitten is because of its association with human habitation and many bites actually occur indoors ( Sasa & Vázquez , 2003 ) .	Bothrops asper
835727589_12599-12966	This species is irritable and fast - moving . It is also regarded as being more excitable and unpredictable than B. atrox . Its large size and habit of raising its head high off the ground can result in bites above the knee . It has also been observed to eject venom over a distance of at least 6 ft ( 1.8 m ) in fine jets from the tips of its fangs ( Mole , 1924 ) .	Bothrops asper
835727589_12967-13645	Bite symptoms include pain , oozing from the puncture wounds , local swelling that may increase for up to 36 hours , bruising that spreads from the bite site , blisters , numbness , mild fever , headache , bleeding from the nose and gums , hemoptysis , gastrointestinal bleeding , hematuria , hypotension , nausea , vomiting , impaired consciousness and tenderness of the spleen . In untreated cases , local necrosis frequently occurs and may cause gangrene which often requires amputation . In 12 fatal cases , the cause of death was sepsis ( 5 ) , intracranial hemorrhage ( 3 ) , acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis ( 2 ) and hemorrhagic shock ( 1 ) .	Bothrops asper
835727589_13646-13776	Venom yield ( dry weight ) averages 458 mg , with a maximum of 1530 mg ( Bolaños , 1984 ) and an LD in mice of 2.844 mg / kg IP .	Bothrops asper
835727589_13777-13999	The venomous bite of B. asper has been suggested to have been a factor in the choice of certain Mayan settlements , such as Nim Li Punit , where the thick jungle inhabited by these snakes was used as a defensive boundary .	Bothrops asper
835727589_14018-14100	This species is a subspecies of B. atrox and can still often confused be with it .	Bothrops asper
835727589_14120-14316	Despite being one of the most venomous snakes in Central and South America , the snake is often preyed on by spiders , specifically the Goliath tarantula . The Jaguar will also prey on the snake .	Bothrops asper

Translator Richard Francis Burton Country United Kingdom Language English Subject Arab folktales and stories Genre Arabic literature Fantasy fiction Publisher Privately printed by the `` Kama Shastra Society '' Publication date 1885 ISBN 978 - 0517001523 Followed by The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night ( 1886 -- 88 )	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_726-1380	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night ( 1885 ) , subtitled A Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights Entertainments , is an English language translation of One Thousand and One Nights ( the `` Arabian Nights '' ) -- a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age ( 8th − 13th centuries ) -- by the British explorer and Arabist Richard Francis Burton ( 1821 -- 1890 ) . It stood as the only complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition ( Egyptian recension ) of the `` Arabian Nights '' until the Malcolm C. and Ursula Lyons translation in 2008 .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_1381-2770	Burton 's translation was one of two unabridged and unexpurgated English translations done in the 1880s ; the first was by John Payne , under the title The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night ( 1882 -- 84 , nine volumes ) . Burton 's ten volume version was published almost immediately afterward with a slightly different title . This , along with the fact that Burton closely advised Payne and partially based his books on Payne 's , led later to charges of plagiarism . Owing to the sexual imagery in the source texts ( which Burton made a special study of , adding extensive footnotes and appendices on `` Oriental '' sexual mores ) and to the strict Victorian laws on obscene material , both translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only , rather than being published in the usual manner . Burton 's original ten volumes were followed by a further six entitled The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night ( 1886 -- 88 ) . Burton 's 16 volumes , while boasting many prominent admirers , have been criticised for their `` archaic language and extravagant idiom '' and `` obsessive focus on sexuality '' ; they have even been called an `` eccentric ego - trip '' and a `` highly personal reworking of the text '' . His voluminous and obscurely detailed notes and appendices have been characterised as `` obtrusive , kinky and highly personal '' .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_2771-3140	In 1982 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) began naming features on Saturn 's moon Enceladus after characters and places in Burton 's translation because `` its surface is so strange and mysterious that it was given the Arabian Nights as a name bank , linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasy '' . ( See List of geological features on Enceladus . )	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_3473-4108	Burton -- an accomplished geographer , explorer , orientalist , ethnologist , diplomat , polylinguist and author -- was best known in his lifetime for travelling in disguise to Mecca ( 1853 ) and for journeying ( with John Hanning Speke ) as the first European to visit the Great Lakes of Africa in search of the source of the Nile ( 1857 -- 58 ) . One of the great Arabists of his day , he had long wanted to publish an unexpurgated version of the `` Arabian Nights '' stories . The first translations into English , notably that by Edward Lane ( 1840 , 1859 ) , were highly abridged and heavily bowdlerised , which irritated Burton .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_4109-5201	In 1863 Burton co-founded the Anthropological Society of London with Dr. James Hunt . In Burton 's own words , the main aim of the society ( through the publication of the periodical Anthropologia ) was `` to supply travelers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters '' . Burton had written numerous travel books which invariably included sexual curiosa in extensive footnotes and appendices . His best - known contributions to literature were those considered risqué or even pornographic at the time and which were published under the auspices of the `` Kama Shastra Society '' , a fictitious organisation created by Burton and Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot as a legal device to avoid the consequences of current obscenity laws . ( Burton and Arbuthnot were the only members of the `` Society '' . ) These works included The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana ( 1883 ) , published just before his Nights , and The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi ( 1886 ) , published just after it .

805615451_5417-5824	The volumes were printed by the Kama Shastra Society in a subscribers - only edition of one thousand with a guarantee that there would never be a larger printing of the books in this form . To confound possible litigation , the title pages claimed the printing had been done in `` Benares '' , but this was a subterfuge . In reality , it was done by Miller & Richard ( a Scottish firm ) at Stoke Newington .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_5948-6483	The stories collected in the Nights are often sexual in content and were considered pornography at the time of Burton 's publication . The Terminal Essay in volume 10 of Burton 's Nights contains a 14,000 - word section entitled `` Pederasty '' ( Volume 10 , section IV , D ) . Here Burton postulated that male homosexuality was prevalent in an area of the southern latitudes named by him the `` Sotadic zone '' . ( Rumors about Burton 's own sexuality and experiences were already circulating and were further incited by this work . )	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night

805615451_6595-7062	John Payne and Burton collaborated on their respective translations of the Nights for more than half a decade , and each respected the other 's scholarship , but Payne believed that Burton had plagiarised his manuscripts when he sent them to Trieste to be checked . In 1906 , a biographer of Burton , Thomas Wright , made the claim that Burton had plagiarised most of his translation from Payne . Burton 's most recent biographer summarises the situation as follows .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_7063-7597	He ( Wright ) made a comparison of the respective versions of the Nights by Burton and Payne . We know , not only from Richard 's and Isabel 's writings but from the statements of people who met him through the years , that Burton had been collecting manuscripts of the Nights stories and translating them , on and off , for over twenty - five years before he met Payne . So Wright 's claim that Burton had not done his own translation , but had `` taken from Payne at least three - quarters of his entire work '' , is extraordinary .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_7598-8063	Norman Mosley Penzer , in his 1923 Annotated Bibliography of Burton 's works , takes great umbrage at `` Wright 's futile efforts to glorify Payne and scoff at Burton '' , contradicting several of his examples point by point . In Burton 's defence , Penzer asserts that it is usual for translators to study and follow in the footsteps of earlier translators and cites examples of similarities in the stories Payne translated after Burton had published his version .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_8064-8201	The `` plagiarism '' allegation is also examined in detail in an appendix to Fawn Brodie 's 1967 biography of Burton , The Devil Drives .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_8217-8521	In translating the Nights , Burton attempted to invent an English equivalent of medieval Arabic . In doing so , he drew upon Chaucerian English , Elizabethan English , and the 1653 English translation by Sir Thomas Urquhart of the first three books of Rabelais 's Gargantua and Pantagruel ( 1532 - 46 ) .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night
805615451_8580-9601	Burton shared ( John ) Payne 's enthusiasm for archaic and forgotten words . The style Burton achieved can be described as a sort of composite mock - Gothic , combining elements from Middle English , the Authorized Version of the Bible and Jacobean drama . Most modern readers will also find Burton 's Victorian vulgarisms jarring , for example ' regular Joe Millers ' , ' Charlie Charleys ' , and ' red cent ' . Burton 's translation of the Nights can certainly be recommended to anyone wishing to increase their word - power : ' chevisance ' , ' fortalice ' , ' kemperly ' , ' car cark ' , ' foison ' , ' soothfast ' , ' perlection ' , ' wittol ' , ' parergon ' , ' brewis ' , ' wikt : bles ' , ' fadaise ' , ' coelebs ' , ' vivisepulture ' , and so on . ' Whilome ' and ' anent ' are standard in Burton 's vocabulary . The range of vocabulary is wider and stranger than Payne 's , lurching between the erudite and the plain earthy , so that Harun al - Rashid and Sinbad walk and talk in a linguistic Never Never Land .

805615451_9700-10695	Many early commentators on Burton 's Nights criticised his eccentric `` mixture of obsolete words , mediaeval phrases , modern slang , Americanisms , and foreign words and expressions '' . Jorge Luis Borges , however , wrote a celebrated essay on `` The Translators of The Thousand and One Nights '' in which -- while he chastises Burton for his distortions and `` indulgent loitering '' -- he allows that `` the problems that Burton resolved are innumerable '' and delights in his careful use of an extravagantly exotic vocabulary in which each word `` is indubitably the mot juste . '' In summarising his use of language , Borges concluded that `` In some way , the almost inexhaustible process of English is adumbrated in Burton -- John Donne 's hard obscenity , the gigantic vocabularies of Shakespeare and Cyril Tourneur , Swinburne 's affinity for the archaic , the crass erudition of the authors of 17th century chapbooks , the energy and imprecision , the love of tempests and magic .

805615451_11853-12605	This edition is ostensibly the `` family '' version of Burton 's translation . ( In her `` Preface '' , Lady Burton guarantees that `` no mother shall regret her girl 's reading this Arabian Nights '' . ) It is a much bowdlerized version of the original edition and was not a commercial success . It excises 215 of the original 3,215 pages , including Burton 's defense of turpiquilum in his `` Foreword '' , all sexually explicit commentary , and the two final essays on `` Pornography '' and `` Pederasty . '' Lady Burton merely lent her name to this expurgated edition . As she stated before his death , `` I have never read , nor do I intend to read , at his own request , and to be true to my promise to him , my husband 's ' Arabian Nights ' `` .

805615451_13192-14106	Nichols ' second printing is a scarce and handsome edition , the first to include the illustrations by Letchford . In 1896 , two years after their first edition of Burton 's Nights , the Nichols - Smithers duo commissioned Burton 's close friend , Albert Letchford , to paint 65 illustrations for another edition as well as a portrait of Burton , and soon after commissioned for five more . Burton and Letchford had met several years before when the latter was 18 and in Florence beginning his art education . They discussed the possibility of illustrating the Nights . Burton 's suggestion of illustrating the Nights had appealed greatly to Letchford on account of the unlimited scope such a subject would give to an artist who loved the East and had a boundless imagination . Letchford commenced study of Eastern images for his paintings , though only one of the illustrations was painted in Burton 's lifetime .	The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night

805615451_14752-16091	The electros from the `` Burton Society '' edition were acquired by the `` Burton Club '' -- `` the nom de plume of a certain Boston publisher '' , according to N.C. Penzer . This very successful series of editions probably began in 1903 ( none of the volumes bear dates ) and continued for many decades . There are 114 illustrations by various ( at least 13 ) English and French artists . Many of these are uncredited and many are from other ( some pre-Burton ) editions of the Nights , some even having nothing to do with the Nights or even the Middle East . ( All of Letchford 's works from the Nichols / Smithers edition are there , except the portrait of Burton . ) . Penzer 's bibliography lists nine different Burton Club editions ; after about 1905 each was named after a city ( Benares , Mecca , Medinah , Aden , Baghdad , Samara , Bassorah , Shammar , and Luristan ) , a new one appearing about every two years . Penzer called these the `` Catch Word '' editions and there are known to be at least 6 others ( Teheran , Baroda , etc ) . These editions were made semi-surreptitiously up through the 1920s and many may have been printed in the US , but bound in the UK . There exists no definitive list of all `` Burton Club '' editions or their sequence . According to Penzer , the `` Illustrated Benares '' edition was the first .

838394480_1342-1889	Released by Hollywood Pictures on August 6 , 1999 , the film was well - received by critics ; praise was given to its acting performances ( particularly Willis , Osment , and Toni Collette ) , atmosphere , and twist conclusion . The Sixth Sense was the second - highest - grossing film of 1999 ( behind Star Wars : Episode I -- The Phantom Menace ) , taking about $293 million in the US and $672 million in other markets . This made it the highest - grossing horror film ( in unadjusted dollars ) until that time ; it was surpassed by It in 2017 .	The Sixth Sense
838394480_1890-2097	The film was nominated for six Academy Awards , including Best Picture , Best Director for Shyamalan , Best Original Screenplay , Best Supporting Actor for Osment , and Best Supporting Actress for Collette .	The Sixth Sense
838394480_2295-2778	Malcolm Crowe , a child psychologist in Philadelphia , returns home one night with his wife , Anna , after having been honored for his work . Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work , and that she believes he is truly gifted . A young man then appears in their bathroom , and accuses Crowe of failing him . Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey , a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations . Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself .	The Sixth Sense
838394480_2779-3495	The next fall , Crowe begins working with another patient , nine - year - old Cole Sear , whose case is similar to Vincent 's . Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy , though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent . Meanwhile , he and his wife seldom , if ever , speak or do anything together . Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife . Cole 's mother , Lynn worries about his social stamina , especially after seeing signs of physical abuse . Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe in the iconic line : `` I see dead people . '' He sees ghosts , who walk around like the living unaware they are dead .	The Sixth Sense
838394480_3496-4218	At first , Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case . Remembering Vincent , the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child . On the tape , when Crowe leaves the room , Vincent begins crying . Turning up the volume , Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish , and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability . He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business . At first , Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him , but he finally decides to attempt helping .	The Sixth Sense
838394480_4219-4661	Cole talks to one of the ghosts , a young girl named Kyra who recently died after a chronic illness . He goes with Crowe to her funeral reception at her home , where Kyra directs him to a box holding a videotape , which he then gives to her father . The tape shows Kyra 's mother poisoning her daughter 's food . By proving she was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy , Cole has saved Kyra 's younger sister , the mother 's next victim .	The Sixth Sense
838394480_4662-5605	Learning to live with the ghosts he sees , Cole begins to fit in at school and is cast as the lead in the school play , which Crowe attends . The doctor and patient depart on positive terms and Cole suggests to Crowe that he should try speaking to Anna while she is asleep . Later , while stuck in traffic , Cole confesses his secret to his mother , saying that someone died in an accident ahead of their traffic and he knows because the person is next to him . Although his mother at first does not believe him , Cole proves his ability to her by talking about how his grandmother visits him . He describes how his grandmother saw his mother in a dance performance , even though Lynn thought her mother was not there . He further relays the answer to a question his mother privately asked at her mother 's grave , `` Every day . '' When Cole asks what question she asked , his mother tearfully answers , `` Do I make you proud ? '' They hug .	The Sixth Sense
838394480_5606-6260	Crowe returns home , where he finds his wife asleep with their wedding video playing . While still asleep , Anna asks her husband why he left her , and drops Crowe 's wedding ring , which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing . He remembers what Cole said about ghosts and realizes that he has actually been dead the whole time . Because of Cole 's efforts , Crowe 's unfinished business -- rectifying his failure to understand and help Vincent -- is finally complete . Crowe fulfills the second reason he returned ; to tell his wife she was never second , and that he loves her . His goal complete , he is free to leave the world of the living .	The Sixth Sense

Without obtaining corporate approval , Vogel bought the rights to the script , despite the high price of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film . Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio , with Vogel leaving the company shortly thereafter . Disney -- apparently in a show of little confidence in the film -- sold the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment , while retaining the distribution rights and 12.5 % of the film 's box office receipt .

838394480_8042-8540	All of the clothes Malcolm wears during the film are items he wore or touched the evening before his death , which included his overcoat , his blue rowing sweatshirt and the different layers of his suit . Though the filmmakers were careful about clues of Malcolm 's true state , the camera zooms slowly towards his face when Cole says , `` I see dead people . '' In a special feature , the filmmakers mention they initially feared this would be too much of a giveaway , but decided to leave it in .	The Sixth Sense
838394480_8636-9294	The film had a production budget of approximately $40 million ( plus $25 million for prints and advertising ) .

828727772_649-1214	The mercury - in - glass or mercury thermometer was invented by physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in Amsterdam ( 1714 ) . It consists of a bulb containing mercury attached to a glass tube of narrow diameter ; the volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume of the bulb . The volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature ; the small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column a relatively long way up the tube . The space above the mercury may be filled with nitrogen or it may be at less than atmospheric pressure , a partial vacuum .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_1215-1860	In order to calibrate the thermometer , the bulb is made to reach thermal equilibrium with a temperature standard such as an ice / water mixture , and then with another standard such as water / vapour , and the tube is divided into regular intervals between the fixed points . In principle , thermometers made of different material ( e.g. , coloured alcohol thermometers ) might be expected to give different intermediate readings due to different expansion properties ; in practice the substances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics as a function of true thermodynamic temperature , and so give similar results .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_1861-2027	The application of mercury ( 1714 ) and Fahrenheit scale ( 1724 ) for liquid - in - glass thermometers ushered in a new era of accuracy and precision in thermometry .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_2513-2672	Anders Celsius , a Swedish scientist , devised the Celsius scale , which was described in his publication The origin of the Celsius temperature scale in 1742 .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_2673-3571	Celsius used two fixed points in his scale : the temperature of melting ice and the temperature of boiling water . This was n't a new idea , since Isaac Newton was already working on something similar . The distinction of Celsius was to use the condition of melting and not that of freezing . The experiments for reaching a good calibration of his thermometer lasted for 2 winters . By performing the same experiment over and over again , he discovered that ice always melted at the same calibration mark on the thermometer . He found a similar fixed point in the calibration of boiling water to water vapour ( when this is done to high precision , a variation will be seen with atmospheric pressure ; Celsius noted this ) . At the moment that he removed the thermometer from the vapour , the mercury level climbed slightly . This was related to the rapid cooling ( and contraction ) of the glass .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_3572-4024	When Celsius decided to use his own temperature scale , he originally defined his scale `` upside - down '' , i.e. he chose to set the boiling point of pure water at 0 ° C ( 212 ° F ) and the freezing point at - 100 ° C ( - 32 ° F ) . One year later , Frenchman Jean - Pierre Christin proposed to invert the scale with the freezing point at 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) and the boiling point at 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) . He named it Centigrade ( 100 grades ) .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_4092-4460	Place the cylinder of the thermometer in melting ice made of pure water and mark the point where the fluid in the thermometer stabilises . This point is the freeze / thaw point of water . In the same manner mark the point where the fluid stabilises when the thermometer is placed in boiling water vapour . Divide the length between the two marks into 100 equal parts .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_4461-4697	These points are adequate for approximate calibration but both vary with atmospheric pressure . Nowadays , the triple point of water is used instead of the freezing point ( the triple point occurs at 273.16 kelvins ( K ) , 0.01 ° C ) .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_4698-5147	Before the discovery of the true thermodynamic temperature , the thermometer defined the temperature ; thermometers made with different materials would define different temperature scales ( a coloured alcohol thermometer would give a slightly different reading than a mercury thermometer at , say half - scale ) . In practice , several materials gave very similar temperatures to each other and , when discovered , to the thermodynamic temperature .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_5350-5956	One special kind of mercury - in - glass thermometer , called a maximum thermometer , works by having a constriction in the neck close to the bulb . As the temperature rises , the mercury is pushed up through the constriction by the force of expansion . When the temperature falls , the column of mercury breaks at the constriction and can not return to the bulb , thus remaining stationary in the tube . The observer can then read the maximum temperature over the set period of time . To reset the thermometer it must be swung sharply . This design is used in the traditional type of medical thermometer .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_5994-6437	A maximum minimum thermometer , also known as Six 's thermometer , is a thermometer which registers the maximum and minimum temperatures reached over a period of time , typically 24 hours . The original design contains mercury , but solely as a way to indicate the position of a column of alcohol whose expansion indicates the temperature ; it is not a thermometer operated by the expansion of mercury ; mercury - free versions are available .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_6467-6958	Mercury thermometers cover a wide temperature range from − 37 to 356 ° C ( − 35 to 673 ° F ) ; the instrument 's upper temperature range may be extended though the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen . This introduction of an inert gas increases the pressure on the liquid mercury and therefore its boiling point is increased , this in combination with replacing the Pyrex glass with fused quartz allows the upper temperature range to be extended to 800 ° C ( 1,470 ° F ) .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_6959-7474	Mercury can not be used below the temperature at which it becomes solid , − 38.83 ° C ( − 37.89 ° F ) . If the thermometer contains nitrogen , the gas may flow down into the column when the mercury solidifies and be trapped there when the temperature rises , making the thermometer unusable until returned to the factory for reconditioning . To avoid this , some weather services require that all mercury - in - glass thermometers be brought indoors when the temperature falls to − 37 ° C ( − 35 ° F ) .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_7475-7674	To measure lower meteorological temperatures , a thermometer containing a mercury - thallium alloy which does not solidify until the temperature drops to − 61.1 ° C ( − 78.0 ° F ) may be used .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_7696-8028	As of 2012 , many mercury - in - glass thermometers are used in meteorology ; however , they are becoming increasingly rare for other uses , as many countries banned them for medical use due to the toxicity of mercury . Some manufacturers use galinstan , a liquid alloy of gallium , indium , and tin , as a replacement for mercury .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_8029-8281	The typical `` fever thermometer '' contains between 0.5 and 0.3 g ( 0.28 and 0.17 drachms ) of elemental mercury . Swallowing this amount of mercury would , it is said , pose little danger but the inhaling of the vapour could lead to health problems .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_8755-9139	In February 2009 , the Argentine Health Ministry instructed by resolution 139 / 09 that all health centres and hospitals should buy mercury - free thermometers and blood pressure meters and called on dentists , medical technicians , and environmental health specialists to start eliminating this toxin . As of 2016 mercury thermometers were still on sale to the public at pharmacies .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_9148-10415	There was a voluntary take - back action for thermometers containing mercury based on the Federal Waste Management Plan 2006 , and carried out in close cooperation between the Austrian Chamber of Pharmacists ( Österreichische Apothekerkammer ) , the Federal Ministry of Environment , a private waste disposer , a producer of electronic thermometers and a pharmaceutical distributor . The disposal company supplied each pharmacy ( approximately 1,200 ) with a collection bin and covered the cost of disposal . The pharmaceutical distributor covered the logistical costs for the distribution of the thermometers . The pharmacies accepted a refund of only 0.50 Euro per thermometer for handling ( which is far below their normal margin ) . The supplier provided the thermometers at a reduced price . The Federal Ministry supported each sold thermometer ( covering about 30 % of the direct costs ) and advertised the project . During the collection period , consumers could bring in a mercury thermometer and buy an electronic thermometer for a subsidised price of 1 Euro . Between October 2007 and January 2008 , about 465,000 electronic thermometers were sold and about one million mercury thermometers ( together containing about 1 tonne of mercury ) were collected .

828727772_10428-11248	By the Philippines Department of Health 's Administrative Order 2008 - 0221 , all mercury equipment from hospitals , including mercury - in - glass thermometers , will be phased out in the Philippines by September 28 , 2010 . Even before the order was released , 50 hospitals have already banned mercury from their establishments . Among these fifty hospitals , the Philippine Heart Center was the first one to do so . San Juan de Dios Hospital , Philippine Children 's Medical Center , San Lazaro Hospital , Ospital ng Muntinlupa , Lung Center of the Philippines , the National Kidney and Transplant Institute , Manila Adventist Medical Center and Las Piñas Hospital also made steps to ban the toxic chemical . The country was the first one to make a step to ban mercury from its health care system in Southeast Asia .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer
828727772_11264-11852	Since European Union directive 2007 / 51 / EC came into force on 3 April 2009 , the UK Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) reported that mercury thermometers could no longer be sold to the general public . Shops holding stocks of unsold thermometers had to withdraw them from sale ; mercury thermometers purchased before this date could be used without legal implications . The purpose of these restrictions is to protect the environment and public health by decreasing the amount of mercury waste released . The HPA had , in 2007 , released a guide to dealing with small spills of mercury .	Mercury-in-glass thermometer

836599528_679-1140	Franchising is based on a marketing concept which can be adopted by an organisation as a strategy for business expansion . Where implemented , a franchiser licenses its know - how , procedures , intellectual property , use of its business model , brand ; and rights to sell its branded products and services to a franchisee . In return the franchisee pays certain fees and agrees to comply with certain obligations , typically set out in a Franchise Agreement .	Franchising
836599528_1141-1634	The word `` franchise '' is of Anglo - French derivation -- from franc , meaning free -- and is used both as a noun and as a ( transitive ) verb . For the franchiser , use of a franchise system is an alternative business growth strategy , compared to say expansion through corporate owned outlets or `` chain stores '' . Adopting a franchise system business growth strategy for the sale and distribution of goods and services minimizes the franchiser 's capital investment and liability risk .	Franchising
836599528_1635-1819	As with any business venture , franchising is not immune to risk . But if undertaken in the right way , franchising can be a vehicle of success for both the franchisor and franchisee .	Franchising
836599528_1820-2060	Thirty - three countries have laws that explicitly regulate franchising , with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising . Franchising is also used as a foreign market entry mode .	Franchising
836599528_2704-3329	The boom in franchising did not take place until after World War II . Nevertheless , the rudiments of modern franchising date back to the Middle Ages when landowners made franchise - like agreements with tax collectors , who retained a percentage of the money they collected and turned the rest over . The practice ended around 1562 but spread to other endeavors . For example , in 17th century England franchisees were granted the right to sponsor markets and fairs or operate ferries . There was little growth in franchising , though , until the mid-19th century , when it appeared in the United States for the first time .	Franchising
836599528_3330-3781	One of the first successful American franchising operations was started by an enterprising druggist named John S. Pemberton . In 1886 , he concocted a beverage comprising sugar , molasses , spices , and cocaine ( which is no longer an ingredient ) . Pemberton licensed selected people to bottle and sell the drink , which is now known as Coca - Cola . His was one of the earliest -- and most successful -- franchising operations in the United States .	Franchising
836599528_3782-4704	The Singer Company implemented a franchising plan in the 1850s to distribute its sewing machines . The operation failed , though , because the company did not earn much money even though the machines sold well . The dealers , who had exclusive rights to their territories , absorbed most of the profits because of deep discounts . Some failed to push Singer products , so competitors were able to outsell the company . Under the existing contract , Singer could neither withdraw rights granted to franchisees nor send in its own salaried representatives . So , the company started repurchasing the rights it had sold . The experiment proved to be a failure . That may have been one of the first times a franchisor failed , but it was by no means the last . ( Even Colonel Sanders did not initially succeed in his Kentucky Fried Chicken franchising efforts . ) Still , the Singer venture did not put an end to franchising .	Franchising
836599528_4705-5508	Other companies tried franchising in one form or another after the Singer experience . For example , several decades later , General Motors Corporation established a somewhat successful franchising operation in order to raise capital . Perhaps the father of modern franchising , though , is Louis Kroh Liggett . In 1902 , Liggett invited a group of druggists to join a `` drug cooperative . '' As he explained to them , they could increase profits by paying less for their purchases , especially if they set up their own manufacturing company . His idea was to market private label products . About 40 druggists pooled $4,000 of their own money and adopted the name `` Rexall . '' Sales soared , and `` Rexall '' became a franchisor . The chain 's success set a pattern for other franchisors to follow .	Franchising
836599528_5509-6211	Although many business owners did affiliate with cooperative ventures of one type or another , there was little growth in franchising until the early 20th century , and what franchising there was did not take the same form as it does today . As the United States shifted from an agricultural to an industrial economy , manufacturers licensed individuals to sell automobiles , trucks , gasoline , beverages , and a variety of other products . The franchisees did little more than sell the products , though . The sharing of responsibility associated with contemporary franchising arrangement did not exist to any great extent . Consequently , franchising was not a growth industry in the United States .	Franchising
836599528_6212-6504	It was not until the 1960s and 1970s that people began to take a close look at the attractiveness of franchising . The concept intrigued people with entrepreneurial spirit . However , there were serious pitfalls for investors , which almost ended the practice before it became truly popular .	Franchising

The United States is a leader in franchising , a position it has held since the 1930s when it used the approach for fast - food restaurants , food inns and , slightly later , motels at the time of the Great Depression . As of 2005 , there were 909,253 established franchised businesses , generating $880.9 billion of output and accounting for 8.1 percent of all private , non-farm jobs .

836599528_8544-8927	Three important payments are made to a franchisor : ( a ) a royalty for the trademark , ( b ) reimbursement for the training and advisory services given to the franchisee , and ( c ) a percentage of the individual business unit 's sales . These three fees may be combined in a single ' management ' fee . A fee for `` disclosure '' is separate and is always a `` front - end fee '' .	Franchising
836599528_8928-9578	A franchise usually lasts for a fixed time period ( broken down into shorter periods , which each require renewal ) , and serves a specific territory or geographical area surrounding its location . One franchisee may manage several such locations . Agreements typically last from five to thirty years , with premature cancellations or terminations of most contracts bearing serious consequences for franchisees . A franchise is merely a temporary business investment involving renting or leasing an opportunity , not the purchase of a business for the purpose of ownership . It is classified as a wasting asset due to the finite term of the license .	Franchising
836599528_9579-9883	Franchise fees are on average 6.7 % with an additional average marketing fee of 2 % However , not all franchise opportunities are the same and many franchise organizations are pioneering new models that challenge antiquated structures and redefine success for the organization as well as the franchisee .	Franchising
836599528_9959-10322	Although franchisor revenues and profit may be listed in a franchise disclosure document ( FDD ) , no laws require an estimate of franchisee profitability , which depends on how intensively the franchisee `` works '' the franchise . Therefore , franchisor fees are typically based on `` gross revenue from sales '' and not on profits realized . See remuneration .	Franchising
836599528_10323-10488	Various tangibles and intangibles such as national or international advertising , training and other support services are commonly made available by the franchisor .	Franchising

836599528_10825-11264	Franchising is one of the few means available to access venture capital without the need to give up control of the operation of the chain and build a distribution system for servicing it . After the brand and formula are carefully designed and properly executed , franchisors are able to sell franchises and expand rapidly across countries and continents using the capital and resources of their franchisees while reducing their own risk .	Franchising
836599528_11265-11423	There is also risk for the people buying the franchises . However , failure rates are much lower for franchise businesses than independent business startups .	Franchising
836599528_11424-11636	Franchisor rules imposed by the franchising authority are becoming increasingly strict . Some franchisors are using minor rule violations to terminate contracts and seize the franchise without any reimbursement .	Franchising
836599528_11707-12248	Franchising brings with it several advantages and disadvantages for firms looking to expand into new areas and foreign markets . The primary advantage is that the firm does not have to bear the development cost and risks of opening a foreign market on its own , as the Franchisee is typically responsible for those costs and risks , putting the onus on the Franchisee to build a profitable operation as quickly as possible . Through franchising a firm has the potential of building a global presence quickly and also at a low cost and risk .	Franchising
836599528_12249-13072	A primary disadvantage to franchising is quality control , as the franchisor wants the firm 's brand name to convey a message to consumers about the quality and consistency of the firm 's product . They want the consumer to experience the same quality regardless of location or franchise status . This can prove to be an issue with franchising , as a customer who had a bad experience at one franchise may assume that they will have the same experience at other locations with other services . Distance can make it difficult for firms to detect whether or not the franchises are of poor quality . One way around this disadvantage is to set up extra subsidiaries in each country or state in which the firm expands . This creates a smaller number of franchisees to oversee , which will reduce the quality control challenges .	Franchising
836599528_13109-13875	Each party to a franchise has several interests to protect . The franchisor is involved in securing protection for the trademark , controlling the business concept and securing know - how . The franchisee is obligated to carry out the services for which the trademark has been made prominent or famous . There is a great deal of standardization required . The place of service has to bear the franchisor 's signs , logos and trademark in a prominent place . The uniforms worn by the staff of the franchisee have to be of a particular design and color . The service has to be in accordance with the pattern followed by the franchisor in the successful franchise operations . Thus , franchisees are not in full control of the business , as they would be in retailing .	Franchising
836599528_13876-14436	A service can be successful if equipment and supplies are purchased at a fair price from the franchisor or sources recommended by the franchisor . A coffee brew , for example , can be readily identified by the trademark if its raw materials come from a particular supplier . If the franchisor requires purchase from her stores , it may come under anti-trust legislation or equivalent laws of other countries . So too the purchase things like uniforms of personnel and signs , as well as the franchise sites , if they are owned or controlled by the franchisor .	Franchising
836599528_14437-15077	The franchisee must carefully negotiate the license and must develop a marketing or business plan with the franchisor . The fees must be fully disclosed and there should not be any hidden fees . The start - up costs and working capital must be known before the license is granted . There must be assurance that additional licensees will not crowd the `` territory '' if the franchise is worked according to plan . The franchisee must be seen as an independent merchant . It must be protected by the franchisor from any trademark infringement by third parties . A franchise attorney is required to assist the franchisee during negotiations .	Franchising
836599528_15078-15582	Often the training period -- the costs of which are in great part covered by the initial fee -- is too short in cases where it is necessary to operate complicated equipment , and the franchisee has to learn on their own from instruction manuals . The training period must be adequate , but in low - cost franchises it may be considered expensive . Many franchisors have set up corporate universities to train staff online . This is in addition to providing literature , sales documents and email access .	Franchising
836599528_15583-16304	Also , franchise agreements carry no guarantees or warranties and the franchisee has little or no recourse to legal intervention in the event of a dispute . Franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor , who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the non-negotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge , in effect , that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk , and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor . Contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor . Most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated .

836599528_17017-17420	Franchising in Australia commenced in a significant way in the early 1970 's under the influence of the franchised US fast food systems such as KFC , Pizza Hut , and McDonald 's . It was however underway prior to this and a decade earlier in 1960 Leslie Joseph Hooker , considered a pioneer of franchising , created Australia 's first national real estate agency network of Hooker real estate agencies .

836599528_17421-17893	In Australia , franchising is regulated by the Franchising Code of Conduct , a mandatory code of conduct concluded under the Trade Practices Act 1974 . The ACCC regulates the Franchising Code of Conduct , which is a mandatory industry code that applies to the parties to a franchise agreement . This code requires franchisors to produce a disclosure document which must be given to a prospective franchisee at least 14 days before the franchise agreement is entered into .	Franchising
836599528_17894-18097	The code also regulates the content of franchise agreements , for example in relation to marketing funds , a cooling - off period , termination , and the resolution of disputes by mediation . Franchising	Franchising

836599528_19462-20010	New Zealand is served by around 423 franchise systems operating 450 brands , giving it the highest proportion of franchises per capita in the world . Despite ( or because of ) the recession , the total number of franchised units increased by 5.3 % from 2009 to 2010 . There is no separate law covering franchises , so they are covered by normal commercial law . This functions very well in New Zealand and includes law as it applies to contracts , restrictive trade practices , intellectual property and the law of misleading or deceptive conduct .	Franchising
836599528_20011-20345	The Franchise Association of New Zealand introduced a self - regulatory code of practice for its members in 1996 . This contains many provisions similar to those of the Australian Franchising Code of Practice legislation , although only around a third of all franchises are members of the association and therefore bound by the code .

836599528_20346-20997	A case of fraud in 2007 perpetrated by a former master franchisee of the country 's largest franchise system led to a review of the need for franchise law by the Ministry of Economic Development . The New Zealand Government decided there was no case for franchise - specific legislation at that time . This decision was criticised by the opposition , which had initiated the review when in power , and the review process was questioned by a leading academic . The Franchise Association originally supported the positive regulation of the franchise sector but its eventual submission to the review was in favour of the status quo -- self - regulation .

836599528_21014-21283	By the end of 2012 , there were about 2,031 franchise brands operating in Brazil , with approximately 93,000 locations , making it one of the largest countries in the world in terms of number of units . Around 11 percent of this total were foreign - based franchisors .	Franchising
836599528_21284-22327	The Brazilian Franchise Law ( Law No. 8955 of December 15 , 1994 ) defines the franchise as a system in which the franchisor licenses the franchisee , for a payment , the right to use a trademark or patent along with the right to distribute products or services on an exclusive or semi-exclusive basis . The provision of a `` Franchise Offer Circular '' , or disclosure document , is mandatory before execution of agreement and is valid for all of the Brazilian territory . Failure to disclose voids the agreement , which leads to refunds and serious payments for damages . The Franchise Law does not distinguish between Brazilian and foreign franchisors . The National Institute of Industrial Property ( INPI ) is the registering authority . Indispensable documents are a Statement of Delivery ( of disclosure documentation ) and a Certification of Recording ( INPI ) . The latter is necessary for payments . All sums may not be convertible into foreign currency . Certification may also mean compliance with Brazil 's antitrust legislation .	Franchising
836599528_22328-22585	Parties to international franchising may decide to adopt the English language for the document , as long as the Brazilian party knows English fluently and expressly acknowledges that fact , to avoid translation . The registration accomplishes three things :	Franchising

836599528_22749-23110	In Canada , recent legislation mandate better disclosure and fair treatment of franchisees . The regulations also ensure their right to form associations and launch collective action , even if they signed contracts prohibiting such moves .

836599528_23126-23770	China has the most franchises in the world but the scale of their operations is relatively small . Each system in China has an average of 43 outlets , compared to more than 540 in the United States . Together , there are 2600 brands in some 200,000 retail markets . KFC was the most significant foreign entry in 1987 and is widespread Many franchises are in fact joint - ventures , as at their forming the franchise law was not explicit . For example , McDonald 's is a joint venture . Pizza Hut , TGIF , Wal - mart , Starbucks followed a little later . But total franchising is only 3 % of retail trade , which seeks foreign franchise growth .	Franchising
836599528_23771-24069	The year 2005 saw the birth of an updated franchise law , `` Measures for the Administration of Commercial Franchise '' .

836599528_26578-27081	The franchising of foreign goods and services to India is in its infancy . The first International Exhibition was only held in 2009 . India is , however , one of the biggest franchising markets because of its large middle - class of 300 million who are not reticent about spending and because the population is entrepreneurial in character . In a highly diversified society , ( see Demographics of India ) McDonald 's is a success story despite its fare 's differing from that of the rest of the world .	Franchising

836599528_27370-28007	In Kazakhstan franchise turnover for 2013 is 2.5 billion US $ dollars per year . Kazakhstan is the leader in Central Asia in the franchising market . There is a special law on franchising which went into effect in 2002 . There are more than 300 franchise systems and the number of franchised outlets approaches 2000 . Kazakhstan franchising began with the emergence of a `` Coca - Cola '' factory , opened to sublicense a Turkish licensor of the same brand . The plant was built in 1994 . Other brands that are also present in Kazakhstan through the franchise system include Pepsi , Hilton , Marriott , Intercontinental , and Pizza Hut .	Franchising
836599528_28024-29178	Franchising has grown rapidly in Europe in recent years , but the industry is largely unregulated . Unlike the United States , the European Union has not adopted a uniform franchise law . Only six of the 28 member states have a pre-contractual disclosure law . They are France ( 1989 ) , Spain ( 1996 ) , Romania ( 1997 ) , Italy ( 2004 ) Sweden ( 2004 ) and Belgium ( 2005 ) . Estonia and Lithuania have franchise laws that impose mandatory terms on franchise agreements . In Spain there is also mandatory registration on a public registry . Although they have no franchise specific laws , Germany and those countries with a legal system based upon that of Germany , such as Austria , Greece and Portugal , probably impose the greatest regulatory burden on franchisors due to their tendency to treat franchisees as quasi consumers in certain circumstances and the willingness of the judiciary to use the concept of good faith to make pro-franchisee decisions . In the UK , the recent Papa John case shows that there is also a need for pre-contractual disclosure and the Yam Seng case shows that there is a duty of good faith in franchise relationships .	Franchising
836599528_29179-29689	The European Franchising Federation 's Code of Ethics has been adopted by seventeen national franchise associations . However this has no legal force and enforcement by the national associations is neither uniform of rigorous . Commentators like Dr Mark Abell , in his book `` The Law and Regulation of Franchising in the EU '' ( Published in 2013 by Edward Elgar ISBN 978 1 78195 2207 ) consider this lack of uniformity to be one of the greatest barriers to the franchising realising its potential in the EU .	Franchising
836599528_29690-30091	When adopting a European strategy it is important that a franchisor takes expert legal advice . Most often one of the principal tasks in Europe is to find retail space , which is not so significant a factor in the USA . This is where the franchise broker , or the master franchisor , plays an important role . Cultural factors are also relevant , as local populations tend to be heterogeneous . France	Franchising
836599528_30101-30485	France is one of Europe 's largest markets . Similar to the United States , it has a long history of franchising , dating back to the 1930s . Growth came in the 1970s . The market is considered difficult for outside franchisors because of cultural characteristics , yet McDonald 's and Century 21 are found everywhere . There are some 30 U.S. firms involved in franchising in France .	Franchising
836599528_30486-31025	There are no government agencies regulating franchises . The Loi Doubin Law of 1989 was the first European franchise disclosure law . Combined with Decree No. 91 - 337 , it regulates disclosure , although the decree also applies to any person who provides to another person a corporate name , trademark or trade name or other business arrangements . The law applies to `` exclusive or quasi-exclusive territory '' . The disclosure document must be delivered at least 20 days before the execution of the agreement or any payments are made .

836599528_31669-32089	Initially , there was some uncertainty whether any breach of the provisions of the Doubin Law would enable the franchisee to walk away from the contract . However , the French supreme court ( Cour de cassation ) eventually ruled that agreements should only be annulled where missing or incorrect information affected the decision of the franchisee to enter into the agreement . The burden of proof is on the franchisee .	Franchising

836599528_32236-32663	Under Italian law franchise is defined as an arrangement between two financially independent parties where a franchisee is granted , in exchange for a consideration , the right to market goods and services under particular trademarks . In addition , articles dictate the form and content of the franchise agreement and define the documents that must be made available 30 days prior to execution .

Norway	Franchising
836599528_33186-33451	There are no specific laws regulating franchising in Norway . However , the Norwegian Competition Act section 10 prohibits cooperation which may prevent , limit or diminish the competition . This may also apply to vertical cooperation such as franchising ... Russia	Franchising
836599528_33461-33940	In Russia , under chapter 54 of the Civil Code ( passed 1996 ) , franchise agreements are invalid unless written and registered , and franchisors can not set standards or limits on the prices of the franchisee 's goods . Enforcement of laws and resolution of contractual disputes is a problem : Dunkin ' Donuts chose to terminate its contract with Russian franchisees who were selling vodka and meat patties contrary to their contracts , rather than pursue legal remedies . Spain	Franchising
836599528_33950-34347	The legal definition of franchising in Spain is an activity in which an undertaking , the franchisor , grants to another party , the franchisee , for a specific market and in exchange for financial compensation ( either direct , indirect or both ) , the right to exploit an owned system to commercialize products or services already exploited by the franchisor with enough success and experience .

836599528_36074-37157	Franchising is a sui generis contract which bears the characteristics of several explicitly regulated contracts such as ; agency , sales contract and so forth . The regulations concerning these kinds of contracts in Turkish Commercial Code and in Turkish Code of Obligations are applied to franchising . Franchising is described in doctrine and has several essential components such as ; the independence of the franchisee from the franchisor , the use of know - how and the uniformity of product and services , standard use of the brand and logo , payment of a royalty fee , increasement of sales by the franchisee and continuity . Franchising may be for a determined or undetermined period of time . The undetermined one can only be annulled either by a notice before a reasonable amount of time or by a just cause . The franchising agreement with a determined time period ends within the end of the time period if not specified otherwise in the agreement . However , termination based on just cause is also foreseen for franchising agreement with a determined time period . United	Franchising
836599528_37175-37392	In the United Kingdom there are no franchise - specific laws ; franchises are subject to the same laws that govern other businesses . There is some self - regulation through the British Franchise Association ( BFA ) .	Franchising
836599528_37393-37859	There are a number franchise businesses which are not members of the BFA and many which do not meet the BFA membership criteria . Part of the BFA 's role in self - regulation is to work with franchisors through the application process and recommend changes which will lead to the franchise business meeting BFA standards . A number of businesses that refer to themselves as franchises do not conform to the BFA Code of Ethics are therefore excluded from membership .	Franchising
836599528_37860-38917	On 22 May 2007 , hearings were held in the UK Parliament concerning citizen - initiated petitions for special regulation of franchising by the government of the UK due to losses incurred by citizens who had invested in franchises . The Minister of Industry , Margaret Hodge , conducted hearings but saw no need for any government regulation of franchising with the advice that government regulation of franchising might lull the public into a false sense of security . Mr Mark Prisk MP suggested that the costs of such regulation to the franchisee and franchisor could be prohibitive and would in any case provide a system which mirrored the work already being completed by the BFA . The Minister of Industry indicated that if due diligence were performed by the investors and the banks , the current laws governing business contracts in the UK offered sufficient protection for the public and the banks . The debate also made reference to the self - regulatory function performed by the BFA recognizing that the association `` punched above its weight '' .	Franchising

836599528_39218-39917	Modern franchising came to prominence with the rise of franchise - based food service establishments . In 1932 , Howard Deering Johnson established the first modern restaurant franchise based on his successful Quincy , Massachusetts Howard Johnson 's restaurant founded in the late 1920s . The idea was to let independent operators use the same name , food , supplies , logo and even building design in exchange for a fee . The growth in franchising accelerated in the 1930s when such chains as Howard Johnson 's started to franchise motels . The 1950s saw a boom in franchise chains in conjunction with the development of the U.S. Interstate Highway System and the growing popularity of fast food .	Franchising
836599528_39918-40119	In the United States , the Federal Trade Commission has oversight of franchising , rather than the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . The FTC administrates oversight via the FTC Franchise Rule .	Franchising
836599528_40120-41125	The FTC requires that the franchisee be furnished with a Franchise Disclosure Document ( FDD ) by the franchisor at least fourteen days before money changes hands or a franchise agreement is signed . The final agreement is always a negotiated document setting forth fees and other terms . Whereas elements of the disclosure may be available from third parties , only that provided by the franchisor can be depended upon . The U.S. Franchise Disclosure Document ( FDD ) is lengthy ( 300 -- 700 pp + ) and detailed ( see Uniform Franchise Offering Circular ( UFOC ) for elements of disclosure ) , and generally requires audited financial statements from the franchisor in a particular format , except in some circumstances , such as where a franchisor is new . It must include such data as the names , addresses and telephone numbers of the franchisees in the licensed territory ( who may be contacted and consulted before negotiations ) , estimate of total franchise revenues and franchisor profitability .	Franchising
836599528_41126-41781	Individual states may require the FDD to contain their own specific requirements , but the requirements in state disclosure documents must be in compliance with the federal rule that governs federal regulatory policy . There is no private right of action of action under the FTC rule for franchisor violation of the rule , but fifteen or more of the states have passed statutes that provide this right of action to franchisees when fraud can be proven under these special statutes . The majority of franchisors have inserted mandatory arbitration clauses into their agreements with their franchisees , some of which the U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with .	Franchising
836599528_41782-42044	There is no federal registry of franchises or any federal filing requirements for information . States are the primary collectors of data on franchising companies and enforce laws and regulations regarding their presence and their spread in their jurisdictions .	Franchising
836599528_42045-42205	Where the franchisor has many partners , the agreement may take the shape of a business format franchise -- an agreement that is identical for all franchisees .	Franchising
836599528_42233-42631	In recent years , the idea of franchising has been picked up by the social enterprise sector , which hopes to simplify and expedite the process of setting up new businesses . A number of business ideas , such as soap making , wholefood retailing , aquarium maintenance , and hotel operation have been identified as suitable for adoption by social firms employing disabled and disadvantaged people .	Franchising
836599528_42632-42973	The most successful examples are probably the Kringwinkel second - hand shops employing 5,000 people in Flanders , franchised by KOMOSIE , the CAP Markets , a steadily growing chain of 100 neighbourhood supermarkets in Germany . and the Hotel Tritone in Trieste , which inspired the Le Mat social franchise , now active in Italy and Sweden .	Franchising
836599528_42974-43126	Social franchising also refers to a technique used by governments and aid donors to provide essential clinical health services in the developing world .	Franchising
836599528_43127-43416	Social Franchise Enterprises objective is to achieve development goals by creating self sustainable activities by providing services and goods in un-served areas . They use the Franchise Model characteristics to deliver Capacity Building , Access to Market and Access to Credit / Finance .	Franchising
836599528_43462-43774	Third - party logistics has become an increasingly more popular franchise opportunity due the quickly growing transportation industry and low cost franchising . In 2012 , Inc. Magazine ranked three logistics and transportation companies in the top 100 fastest growing companies in the annual Inc. 5000 rankings .	Franchising
836599528_43802-44444	Event franchising is the duplication of public events in other geographical areas , retaining the original brand ( logo ) , mission , concept and format of the event . As in classic franchising , event franchising is built on precisely copying successful events . An example of event franchising is the World Economic Forum , also known as the Davos forum , which has regional event franchisees in China , Latin America , etc . Likewise , the alter - globalist World Social Forum has launched many national events . When The Music Stops is an example of an events franchise in the UK , in this case , running speed dating and singles events .	Franchising
836599528_44478-44894	The franchising or duplication of another firm 's successful home - based business model is referred to as a home - based franchise . Home - based franchises are becoming popular as they are considered to be an easy way to start a business as they may provide a low barrier for entry into entrepreneurship . It may cost little to start a home - based franchise , but experts say that `` the work is no less hard . ''	Franchising

Love Me like You Do
819091951_3720-5133	While seeking material for the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack , Republic Records contacted various artists , managers and music publishers to create a compilation that would appropriately represent the film 's tone . `` Love Me like You Do '' was the result of Republic executive Tom Mackay contacting Max Martin 's manager about writing a song for the film . Ilya started writing the chorus , while Ali Payami and Martin came next , with Martin `` tweaking '' the song and Savan Kotecha and Tove Lo also contributing with lyrics . According to Kotecha , `` Love Me Like You Do '' was already being developed by both him and Martin prior to Fifty Shades of Grey , and he had considered giving the song to American singer Demi Lovato . However , after being shown a scene from the film during a meeting for the film 's soundtrack , Martin thought ' Love Me Like You Do ' could work , and began reworking the song for inclusion . After that , the film director Sam Taylor - Johnson asked Ellie Goulding to sing the song . Goulding , who previously contributed songs to the soundtracks to The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 , The Hunger Games : Catching Fire , and Divergent , initially thought about declining the invitation to record another song for a soundtrack to focus on her then upcoming third studio album , however after meeting the film crew and hearing the ballad she accepted . She commented :	Love Me like You Do
819091951_5134-5722	`` I was n't going to get involved in that soundtrack because I 've done a lot of soundtracks and we kind of thought we 've done a bit too much film stuff . So we should probably just chill and write that third album , which is what I should be focusing on . And then I met the director ( Sam Taylor - Johnson ) and everyone involved and I was like , ' This is a pretty cool thing to be involved in . ' Then I heard the song and I was like , ' Woah , this is a pretty awesome song . ' I did n't know that it was going to be this big , genuinely . I thought ( maybe ) it would do well . ''	Love Me like You Do

'' Lyrically , `` Love Me like You Do '' contrasts `` innocent romantic longing '' and `` brooding , addictive , pain - laced sensuality '' , which according to Plugged In 's Adam R. Holz , `` mirrors the story arc of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey '' in both the book and the film . He went on to explain its lyrical content : `` ( It ) tells the tale of a woman entranced and seduced by someone whose touch leaves her begging for more , even when -- or perhaps especially when -- it hurts .

'' Christina Garibaldi of MTV News also called it `` sultry '' and `` soft '' , adding that `` we can totally picture it being played during any steamy scene . '' Ryan Reed of Rolling Stone opined that its `` results are grandiose , considering the film 's sensual subject matter . '' Jim Farber of the NY Daily News praised her `` little - girl - lost voice '' , noting that `` Goulding sounds sweet even when she 's courting danger . The music , likewise , goes for a high gloss take on romance , recalling the heavily echoed beats and dense synthesizers of a Phil Collins ballad from the ' 80s . '' Robbie Daw of Idolator described `` Love Me like You Do '' as `` a sweeping power ballad that finds Goulding delivering soft , understated vocals over producer Max Martin 's swelling bed of synths . '' Lucas Villa of AXS commended Goulding for `` masterfully tread ( ing ) between delicacy and power in her performance '' , calling the song `` intimately magnificent '' . Glenn Gamboa of Newsday called it `` sweet , catchy , near - perfect rom - com fare '' .	Love Me like You Do
819091951_8856-10228	Carolyn Menyes of Music Times complimented the song for being `` sweet and dreamy , like the majority of Goulding 's discography '' , also observing that `` ( t ) he crawling pace works well as Goulding rolls her way through the melody , all at once being enchanting and loving . Her breathy vocals , as always , complete the atmospheric sensibility of the track . '' While reviewing the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack , Dave Holmes wrote for Esquire that the song was `` ( t ) he closest thing to a single we 've heard so far '' , adding that the song has `` a touch of longing , a little bit of a beat '' and `` Goulding 's voice is the sound of heavy petting . '' Mikael Wood , writing for Los Angeles Times , said that Goulding `` put across a tender sensuality ( ... ) even as super-producer Max Martin jacks the stadium - rave beat . '' Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic , in his soundtrack analysis , wrote that `` it moves into the area of background romantic music , a vibe that 's sometimes pierced by those overly familiar oldies that surely play a bigger role onscreen than they do on album . '' In a less favourable review , Jason Lipshutz of Billboard gave the song two and a half stars out of five , complimenting Goulding 's voice as `` one of pop 's more distinct voices '' and the tune 's `` colossal chorus '' , but panning its `` cliched lyrics '' .

He has one daughter from the marriage , Fiona , who emigrated to Canada . Jack spends most of his time with Victor , often visiting their local pub - The Clansman . As Victor is the leader of the two in most situations , Jack is happy to follow him around . He is shown to be slightly less smart than Victor , and more likely to be swayed by peer pressure from Winston and Tam . However , Jack has shown himself to be more observant than Victor on several occasions -- notably when , in the episode `` Wummin , '' he recognises ( albeit incorrectly ) that Bert Findlay 's actions were all signs of an impending suicide . Jack seems to have less of a way with words than Victor , sometimes trying to say something witty but only coming up with a one - word insult .

However , he reveals that his mother 's name was Jenny Turnbull , a woman who Jack , Victor and Winston had sexual relationships with . This meant that one of them could be Chris ' father . They are worried that their families would be disgusted , but Bobby believes that this could save the pub , since no one would demolish their father 's favourite pub . None of the men are successful in finding out but it is Isa who susses it out when she sees an old photo of Winston 's that she took .

819283879_1304-1645	Institutions are `` stable , valued , recurring patterns of behavior '' . As structures or mechanisms of social order , they govern the behaviour of a set of individuals within a given community . Institutions are identified with a social purpose , transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior .	Institution
819283879_1646-2009	The term `` institution '' commonly applies to both informal institutions such as customs , or behavior patterns important to a society , and to particular formal institutions created by entities such as the government and public services . Primary or meta - institutions are institutions such as the family that are broad enough to encompass other institutions .	Institution
819283879_2010-2427	As structures and mechanisms of social order , institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science , anthropology , economics , and sociology ( the latter described by Émile Durkheim as the `` science of institutions , their genesis and their functioning '' ) . Institutions are also a central concern for law , the formal mechanism for political rule - making and enforcement .	Institution
819283879_2719-3098	People may deliberately create individual , formal organizations commonly identified as `` institutions '' -- but the development and function of institutions in society in general may be regarded as an instance of emergence . That is , institutions arise , develop and function in a pattern of social self - organization beyond conscious intentions of the individuals involved .	Institution
819283879_3099-3593	As mechanisms of social interaction , institutions manifest in both formal organizations , such as the U.S. Congress , or the Roman Catholic Church , and , also , in informal social order and organization , reflecting human psychology , culture , habits and customs , and encompassing subjective experience of meaningful enactments . Formal institutions are explicitly set forth by a relevant authority and informal institutions are generally unwritten societal rules , norms , and traditions .	Institution
819283879_3594-4611	Primary or meta - institutions are institutions that encompass many other institutions , both formal and informal ( e.g. the family , government , the economy , education , and religion . Most important institutions , considered abstractly , have both objective and subjective aspects : examples include money and marriage . The institution of money encompasses many formal organizations , including banks and government treasury departments and stock exchanges , which may be termed , `` institutions , '' as well as subjective experiences , which guide people in their pursuit of personal well - being . Powerful institutions are able to imbue a paper currency with certain value , and to induce millions into production and trade in pursuit of economic ends abstractly denominated in that currency 's units . The subjective experience of money is so pervasive and persuasive that economists talk of the `` money illusion '' and try to disabuse their students of it , in preparation for learning economic analysis .

819283879_4920-10660	Family : The family is the center of the child 's life , as infants are totally dependent on others . The family teaches children cultural values and attitudes about themselves and others -- see sociology of the family . Children learn continuously from the environment that adults create . Children also become aware of class at a very early age and assign different values to each class accordingly . Religion : Some believe religion is like an ethnic or cultural category , making it less likely for the individuals to break from religious affiliations and be more socialized in this setting . Parental religious participation is the most influential part of religious socialization -- more so than religious peers or religious beliefs . See sociology of religion and civil religion . Peer groups : A peer group is a social group whose members have interests , social positions and age in common . This is where children can escape supervision and learn to form relationships on their own . The influence of the peer group typically peaks during adolescence however peer groups generally only affect short term interests unlike the family which has long term influence . Economic systems : Economic systems dictate `` acceptable alternatives for consumption , '' `` social values of consumption alternatives , '' the `` establishment of dominant values , '' and `` the nature of involvement in consumption '' . Capitalist society may encourage the growth of centralization and interdependence under the control of an elite . Socialism encourages democratic , bottom - up control by the people and their communities . Legal systems : Children are pressured from both parents and peers to conform and obey certain laws or norms of the group / community . Parents ' attitudes toward legal systems influence children 's views as to what is legally acceptable . For example , children whose parents are continually in jail are more accepting of incarceration . See jurisprudence , philosophy of law , sociology of law . Penal systems : The penal systems acts upon prisoners and the guards . Prison is a separate environment from that of normal society ; prisoners and guards form their own communities and create their own social norms . Guards serve as `` social control agents '' who discipline and provide security . From the view of the prisoners , the communities can be oppressive and domineering , causing feelings of defiance and contempt towards the guards . Because of the change in societies , prisoners experience loneliness , a lack of emotional relationships , a decrease in identity and `` lack of security and autonomy '' . Both the inmates and the guards feel tense , fearful , and defensive , which creates an uneasy atmosphere within the community . See sociology of punishment . Language : People learn to socialize differently depending on the specific language and culture in which they live . A specific example of this is code switching . This is where immigrant children learn to behave in accordance with the languages used in their lives : separate languages at home and in peer groups ( mainly in educational settings ) . Depending on the language and situation at any given time , people will socialize differently . See linguistics , sociolinguistics , sociology of language . Mass media : The mass media are the means for delivering impersonal communications directed to a vast audience . The term media comes from Latin meaning , `` middle , '' suggesting that the media 's function is to connect people . The media can teach norms and values by way of representing symbolic reward and punishment for different kinds of behavior . Mass media has enormous effects on our attitudes and behavior , notably in regards to aggression . See media studies . Learning : Learning can be social or nonsocial . Consider the example of a child learning about bees . If is child is exploring and playing with no one else around , the child may see a bee and touch it ( out of curiosity ) . If the child is stung by the bee , the child learns that touching bees is associated with pain . This is nonsocial learning , since no one else was around . In contrast , a child may benefit from social learning about bees . If the child is with a parent , relative or anyone else , the child 's inquisitive approach to a bee may lead to some kind of social intervention . Maybe Aunt Emy sees the child reaching for a bee and simply points the child in another direction , saying `` Look at that pretty butterfly . '' Maybe Uncle Ed would say , `` Do n't touch the bee , because it can hurt you and make you cry . '' Maybe Mom would have said , `` Honey , stay away from bees because they sting . '' There are all sorts of ways that people can interact with a child to help the child learn to avoid ever being stung . Any and all of these social interventions allow the child to benefit from social learning , though some of these social interventions may be more educational and useful than others . Educational institutions -- schools ( preschool , primary / elementary , secondary , and post-secondary / higher -- see sociology of education ) Research community -- academia and universities ; research institutes -- see sociology of science Medicine -- hospitals and other health care institutions -- see sociology of health and illness , medical sociology Psychiatric hospitals ( history ) Military or paramilitary forces -- see military sociology Industry -- businesses , including corporations -- see financial institution , factory , capitalism , division of labour , social class , industrial sociology Civil society or NGOs -- charitable organizations ; advocacy groups ; political parties ; think tanks ; virtual communities	Institution
819283879_10686-11481	Art and culture ( See also : culture industry , critical theory , cultural studies , cultural sociology ) The nation - state -- Social and political scientists often speak of the state as embodying all institutions such as schools , prisons , police , and so on . However , these institutions may be considered private or autonomous , whilst organised religion and family life certainly pre-date the advent of the nation state . The Neo-Marxist thought of Antonio Gramsci , for instance , distinguishes between institutions of political society ( police , the army , legal system , etc . ) , which dominate directly and coercively -- and civil society ( the family , education system , etc . ) . For example , in Schenck v. United States , the circumstance of which made that speech case special	Institution
819283879_11513-13989	Informal institutions have been largely overlooked in comparative politics , but in many countries it is the informal institutions and rules that govern the political landscape . To understand the political behaviour in a country it is important to look at how that behaviour is enabled or constrained by informal institutions , and how this affects how formal institutions are run . For example , if there are high levels of extra judicial killings in a country , it might be that while it is prohibited by the state the police are actually enabled to carry out such killings and informally encouraged to prop up an inefficient formal state police institution . An informal institution tends to have socially shared rules , which are unwritten and yet are often known by all inhabitants of a certain country , as such they are often referred to as being an inherent part of the culture of a given country . Informal practices are often referred to as `` cultural '' , for example clientelism or corruption is sometimes stated as a part of the political culture in a certain place , but an informal institution itself is not cultural , it may be shaped by culture or behaviour of a given political landscape , but they should be looked at in the same way as formal institutions to understand their role in a given country . Informal institutions might be particularly used to pursue a political agenda , or a course of action that might not be publicly popular , or even legal , and can be seen as an effective way of making up for lack of efficiency in a formal institution . For example , in countries where formal institutions are particularly inefficient , an informal institution may be the most cost effective way or actually carrying out a given task , and this ensures that there is little pressure on the formal institutions to become more efficient . The relationship between formal and informal institutions is often closely aligned and informal institutions step in to prop up inefficient institutions . However , because they do not have a centre , which directs and coordinates their actions , changing informal institutions is a slow and lengthy process . It is as such important to look at any given country and note the presence of informal institutions when looking at the political landscape , and note that they are not necessarily a rejection of the state , but an integral part of it and broadening the scope of the role of the state in a given country .	Institution
819283879_14027-14941	While institutions tend to appear to people in society as part of the natural , unchanging landscape of their lives , study of institutions by the social sciences tends to reveal the nature of institutions as social constructions , artifacts of a particular time , culture and society , produced by collective human choice , though not directly by individual intention . Sociology traditionally analyzed social institutions in terms of interlocking social roles and expectations . Social institutions created and were composed of groups of roles , or expected behaviors . The social function of the institution was executed by the fulfillment of roles . Basic biological requirements , for reproduction and care of the young , are served by the institutions of marriage and family , for example , by creating , elaborating and prescribing the behaviors expected for husband / father , wife / mother , child , etc .	Institution
819283879_14942-15904	The relationship of institutions to human nature is a foundational question for the social sciences . Institutions can be seen as `` naturally '' arising from , and conforming to , human nature -- a fundamentally conservative view -- or institutions can be seen as artificial , almost accidental , and in need of architectural redesign , informed by expert social analysis , to better serve human needs -- a fundamentally progressive view . Adam Smith anchored his economics in the supposed human `` propensity to truck , barter and exchange '' . Modern feminists have criticized traditional marriage and other institutions as element of an oppressive and obsolete patriarchy . The Marxist view -- which sees human nature as historically ' evolving ' towards voluntary social cooperation , shared by some anarchists -- is that supra - individual institutions such as the market and the state are incompatible with the individual liberty of a truly free society .	Institution
819283879_15905-16605	Economics , in recent years , has used game theory to study institutions from two perspectives . Firstly , how do institutions survive and evolve ? In this perspective , institutions arise from Nash equilibria of games . For example , whenever people pass each other in a corridor or thoroughfare , there is a need for customs , which avoid collisions . Such a custom might call for each party to keep to their own right ( or left -- such a choice is arbitrary , it is only necessary that the choice be uniform and consistent ) . Such customs may be supposed to be the origin of rules , such as the rule , adopted in many countries , which requires driving automobiles on the right side of the road .	Institution
819283879_16606-17508	Secondly , how do institutions affect behaviour ? In this perspective , the focus is on behaviour arising from a given set of institutional rules . In these models , institutions determine the rules ( i.e. strategy sets and utility functions ) of games , rather than arise as equilibria out of games . Douglass North argues , the very emergence of an institution reflects behavioral adaptations through his application of increasing returns . Over time institutions develop rules that incentivize certain behaviors over others because they present less risk or induce lower cost , and establish path dependent outcomes . For example , the Cournot duopoly model is based on an institution involving an auctioneer who sells all goods at the market - clearing price . While it is always possible to analyze behaviour with the institutions - as - equilibria approach instead , it is much more complicated .	Institution
819283879_17509-18540	In political science , the effect of institutions on behavior has also been considered from a meme perspective , like game theory borrowed from biology . A `` memetic institutionalism '' has been proposed , suggesting that institutions provide selection environments for political action , whereby differentiated retention arises and thereby a Darwinian evolution of institutions over time . Public choice theory , another branch of economics with a close relationship to political science , considers how government policy choices are made , and seeks to determine what the policy outputs are likely to be , given a particular political decision - making process and context . Credibility thesis purports that institutions emerge from intentional institution - building but never in the originally intended form . Instead , institutional development is endogenous and spontaneously ordered and institutional persistence can be explained by their credibility , which is provided by the function that particular institutions serve .	Institution
819283879_18541-19019	In history , a distinction between eras or periods , implies a major and fundamental change in the system of institutions governing a society . Political and military events are judged to be of historical significance to the extent that they are associated with changes in institutions . In European history , particular significance is attached to the long transition from the feudal institutions of the Middle Ages to the modern institutions , which govern contemporary life .	Institution
819283879_19062-20251	In order to understand why some institutions persist and other institutions only appear in certain contexts , it is important to understand what drives institutional change . Acemoglu , Johnson and Robinson assert that institutional change is endogenous . They posit a framework for institutional change that is rooted in the distribution of resources across society and preexisting political institutions . These two factors determine de jure and de facto political power , respectively , which in turn defines this period 's economic institutions and next period 's political institutions . Finally , the current economic institutions determine next period 's distribution of resources and the cycle repeats . Douglass North attributes institutional change to the work of `` political entrepreneurs '' , who see personal opportunities to be derived from a change institutional framework . These entrepreneurs weigh the expected costs of altering the institutional framework against the benefits they can derive from the change . North describes institutional change as a process that is extremely incremental , and that works through both formal and informal institutions . Institutional	Institution
819283879_20273-21403	North argues that because of the preexisting influence that existing organizations have over the existing framework , change that is brought about is often in the interests of these organizations . This produces a phenomenon called path dependence , which states that institutional patterns are persistent and endure over time . These paths are determined at critical junctures , analogous to a fork in the road , whose outcome leads to a narrowing of possible future outcomes . Once a choice is made during a critical juncture , it becomes progressively difficult to return to the initial point where the choice was made . James Mahoney studies path dependence in the context of national regime change in Central America and finds that liberal policy choices of Central American leaders in the 19th century was the critical juncture that led to the divergent levels of development that we see in these countries today . The policy choices that leaders made in the context of liberal reform policy led to a variety of self - reinforcing institutions that created divergent development outcomes for the Central American countries .	Institution
819283879_21404-22639	Though institutions are persistent , North states that paths can change course when external forces weaken the power of an existing organization . This allows other entrepreneurs to affect change in the institutional framework . This change can also occur as a result of gridlock between political actors produced by a lack of mediating institutions and an inability to reach a bargain . Artificial implementation of institutional change has been tested in political development but can have unintended consequences . North , Wallis , and Weingast divide societies into different social orders : open access orders , which about a dozen developed countries fall into today , and limited access orders , which accounts for the rest of the countries . Open access orders and limited access orders differ fundamentally in the way power and influence is distributed . As a result , open access institutions placed in limited access orders face limited success and are often coopted by the powerful elite for self - enrichment . Transition to more democratic institutions is not created simply by transplanting these institutions into new contexts , but happens when it is in the interest of the dominant coalition to widen access . Natural	Institution
819283879_22659-23642	Ian Lustick suggests that the social sciences , particularly those with the institution as a central concept , can benefit by applying the concept of natural selection to the study of how institutions change over time . By viewing institutions as existing within a fitness landscape , Lustick argues that the gradual improvements typical of many institutions can be seen as analogous to hill - climbing within one of these fitness landscapes . This can eventually lead to institutions becoming stuck on local maxima , such that for the institution to improve any further , it would first need to decrease its overall fitness score ( e.g. , adopt policies that may cause short - term harm to the institution 's members ) . The tendency to get stuck on local maxima can explain why certain types of institutions may continue to have policies that are harmful to its members or to the institution itself , even when members and leadership are all aware of the faults of these policies .	Institution
819283879_23643-24665	As an example , Lustick cites Amyx 's analysis of the gradual rise of the Japanese economy and its seemingly sudden reversal in the so - called `` Lost Decade '' . According to Amyx , Japanese experts were not unaware of the possible causes of Japan 's economic decline . Rather , to return Japan 's economy back to the path to economic prosperity , policymakers would have had to adopt policies that would first cause short - term harm to the Japanese people and government . Under this analysis , says Ian Lustick , Japan was stuck on a `` local maxima , '' which it arrived at through gradual increases in its fitness level , set by the economic landscape of the 1970s and 80s . Without an accompanying change in institutional flexibility , Japan was unable to adapt to changing conditions , and even though experts may have known which changes the country needed , they would have been virtually powerless to enact those changes without instituting unpopular policies that would have been harmful in the short - term .	Institution
819283879_24666-25238	The lessons from Lustick 's analysis applied to Sweden 's economic situation can similarly apply to the political gridlock that often characterizes politics in the United States . For example , Lustick observes that any politician who hopes to run for elected office stands very little to no chance if they enact policies that show no short - term results . Unfortunately , there is a mismatch between policies that bring about short - term benefits with minimal sacrifice , and those that bring about long - lasting change by encouraging institution - level adaptations .	Institution
819283879_25239-26396	There are some criticisms to Lustick 's application of natural selection theory to institutional change . Lustick himself notes that identifying the inability of institutions to adapt as a symptom of being stuck on a local maxima within a fitness landscape does nothing to solve the problem . At the very least , however , it might add credibility to the idea that truly beneficial change might require short - term harm to institutions and their members . David Sloan Wilson notes that Lustick needs to more carefully distinguish between two concepts : multilevel selection theory and evolution on multi-peaked landscapes . Bradley Thayer points out that the concept of a fitness landscape and local maxima only makes sense if one institution can be said to be `` better '' than another , and this in turn only makes sense insofar as there exists some objective measure of an institution 's quality . This may be relatively simple in evaluating the economic prosperity of a society , for example , but it is difficult to see how objectively a measure can be applied to the amount of freedom of a society , or the quality of life of the individuals within .	Institution
819283879_26463-27170	The term `` institutionalization '' is widely used in social theory to refer to the process of embedding something ( for example a concept , a social role , a particular value or mode of behavior ) within an organization , social system , or society as a whole . The term may also be used to refer to committing a particular individual to an institution , such as a mental institution . To this extent , `` institutionalization '' may carry negative connotations regarding the treatment of , and damage caused to , vulnerable human beings by the oppressive or corrupt application of inflexible systems of social , medical , or legal controls by publicly owned , private or not - for - profit organizations .	Institution
819283879_27171-27427	The term `` institutionalization '' may also be used in a political sense to apply to the creation or organization of governmental institutions or particular bodies responsible for overseeing or implementing policy , for example in welfare or development .	Institution

856872117_763-1441	The Mask of Zorro is a 1998 American swashbuckler film based on the character of the masked vigilante Zorro created by Johnston McCulley . It was directed by Martin Campbell and stars Antonio Banderas , Anthony Hopkins , Catherine Zeta - Jones , and Stuart Wilson . The film features the original Zorro , Don Diego de la Vega ( Hopkins ) , escaping from prison to find his long - lost daughter ( Zeta - Jones ) and avenge the death of his wife at the hands of the corrupt governor Rafael Montero ( Wilson ) . He is aided by his successor ( Banderas ) , who is pursuing his own vendetta against the governor 's right - hand man while falling in love with de la Vega 's daughter .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_1442-2132	Producer Steven Spielberg had initially developed the film for TriStar Pictures with directors Mikael Salomon and Robert Rodriguez , before Campbell signed on in 1996 . Salomon cast Sean Connery as Don Diego de la Vega , while Rodriguez brought Banderas in the lead role . Connery dropped out and was replaced with Hopkins , and The Mask of Zorro began filming in January 1997 at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City , Mexico . The film was released in the United States on July 17 , 1998 to critical and commercial success . The Legend of Zorro , a sequel also starring Banderas and Zeta - Jones and directed by Campbell , was released in 2005 , but did not fare as well as its predecessor .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_2408-3740	In 1821 , Don Diego de la Vega ( Anthony Hopkins ) , a Californio nobleman , fights against the Spanish in the Mexican War of Independence as Zorro , a mysterious swordsman who defends the Mexican peasants and commoners of Las Californias . Don Rafael Montero ( Stuart Wilson ) , the corrupt governor of the region , learns of De La Vega 's alter ego , and attempts to arrest him . De la Vega 's wife Esperanza is killed during the scuffle . Montero imprisons de La Vega and takes his infant daughter , Elena , as his own before returning to Spain . Twenty years later Montero returns to California as a civilian , alongside Elena ( Catherine Zeta - Jones ) who has grown into a beautiful woman and resembles her late mother . Montero 's reappearance motivates de La Vega to escape from prison . He encounters a thief , Alejandro Murietta ( Antonio Banderas ) who , as a child , once did Zorro a favor . De la Vega decides that fate has brought them together , and agrees to make Alejandro his protégé , grooming him to be the new Zorro . Alejandro agrees to undergo de La Vega 's training regimen in Zorro 's lair underneath the ruins of his family estate in order to be able to take revenge on Captain Harrison Love ( Matt Letscher ) Montero 's right - hand man , who was responsible for killing Alejandro 's brother , Joaquin .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_3741-4490	While still being trained , Alejandro steals a black stallion resembling Tornado from the local garrison . De La Vega scolds Alejandro , claiming that Zorro was a servant of the people , not a thief and adventurer . He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero 's trust instead . Alejandro poses as a visiting nobleman named Don Alejandro del Castillo y García , with de la Vega as his servant , and attends a party at Montero 's hacienda . At the party he gains Elena 's admiration and enough of Montero 's trust to be invited to a secret meeting where several other noblemen are present . Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons by buying it from General Santa Anna , who needs money to fund his upcoming war with the United States .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_4491-5352	Montero takes Alejandro and the noblemen to a secret gold mine known as `` El Dorado '' , where peasants and prisoners are used for slave labor . Montero plans to buy California from Santa Anna using gold mined from Santa Anna 's own land . De la Vega uses this opportunity to become closer to Elena , though he identifies himself as `` Bernardo '' the servant , learning that Montero told Elena that her mother died in childbirth . While walking in a market , Elena meets the woman who was her nanny who tells Elena her parents ' real identity . De la Vega sends Alejandro , dressed as Zorro , to steal Montero 's map leading to the gold mine . Zorro duels Montero , Love , and their guards at the hacienda . When Zorro escapes , Elena attempts to retrieve Montero 's map from the swordsman , but he seduces her , leading to a passionate kiss before he flees .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_5353-6546	Terrified of Santa Anna 's retribution if he discovers that he is being paid with his own gold , Montero , at Love 's urging , decides to destroy the mine and kill the workers . De la Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so that de La Vega can reclaim Elena . Alejandro sets off , feeling betrayed by Diego 's vendetta . De la Vega corners Montero at the hacienda and reveals his identity , but Montero captures him by threatening Elena . As he is taken away , de la Vega tells Elena the name of the flowers , romneya , she recognized upon her arrival in California , convincing her that he is her father . She releases de la Vega from his cell and they proceed to the mine , where Alejandro and de la Vega respectively defeat and slay Love and Montero . Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go off , and then find the mortally wounded de la Vega . He makes peace with Alejandro before dying , passing the mantle of Zorro to him , and gives his blessings for his marriage to Elena . In a closing sequence they are shown to be living together after rebuilding the de la Vega family señorío with a son named Joaquín , in honor of Alejandro 's brother .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_6596-8187	Antonio Banderas as Alejandro Murrieta / Zorro : Despite claims made by several media outlets and Antonio Banderas , Banderas was not the first Spanish actor to portray Zorro . Spanish actor José Suárez was cast as Zorro in the 1953 film Lawless Mountain , and Spanish actor Carlos Quiney ( aka Charles Quiney ) portrayed Zorro in three films : Zorro 's Latest Adventure ( 1969 ) , Zorro , Rider of Vengeance ( 1971 ) and Zorro the Invincible ( 1971 ) ( though Banderas was still the first Spanish actor to portray Zorro in a Hollywood production ) . Banderas was paid $5 million for the role . The character of Alejandro Murrieta was conceived as the fictional brother of the real - life Joaquin Murrieta , making the character either Mexican or Chilean . To prepare for his role , Banderas practiced with the Olympic fencing team in Spain for four months , before studying additional fencing and swordsmanship with Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta - Jones . The three were trained by Bob Anderson during pre-production in Mexico , spending 10 hours a day for two months specifically on fight scenes from the film . `` We used to call him Grumpy Bob on the set , he was such a perfectionist , '' director Martin Campbell reflected . `` He was incredibly inventive , and also refused to treat any of the actors as stars . They would complain about the intensity of the training , but having worked with him there 's nobody I 'd rather use . '' During interviews for The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring , Anderson rated Banderas the best natural talent he had worked with .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_8249-9035	Anthony Hopkins as Don Diego de la Vega / Zorro : Hopkins was cast in December 1996 , one month before filming began . Hopkins , known for his dramatic acting , took up the role over his enthusiasm to be in an action film . Catherine Zeta - Jones as Elena Montero : The actress signed on in November 1996 , when Spielberg saw her performance in the Titanic miniseries and recommended her to Campbell . Despite being a Welsh actress portraying a Latina character , Zeta - Jones discovered similarities between her `` volatile '' Celtic temper and the Latin temperament of Eléna . Izabella Scorupco , who worked with Campbell on GoldenEye , and Judith Godrèche both screen tested for the part . Zeta - Jones credits The Mask of Zorro as her breakthrough in entering A-list recognition .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_9109-9705	Stuart Wilson as Don Rafael Montero : Armand Assante had initially been cast in the role , but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with The Odyssey .

856872117_9895-10779	In October 1992 , TriStar Pictures and Steven Spielberg 's Amblin Entertainment were planning to start production on Zorro the following year , and hired Joel Gross to rewrite the script after they were impressed with his adaptation of The Three Musketeers . At the time , Spielberg was producing Zorro with the potential to direct . Gross completed his rewrite in March 1993 , and TriStar entered pre-production , creating early promotion for the film that same month at the ShoWest trade show . By December 1993 , Branko Lustig was producing the film with Spielberg , and Mikael Salomon was attached as director . In August 1994 , Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega , while Salomon stated that the rest of the major cast would be Hispanic or Latino . Pre-production proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a planned April 1995 start date .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_10780-12065	Connery and Salomon eventually dropped out , and in September 1995 , Robert Rodriguez , fresh from the success of Desperado , signed to direct with Antonio Banderas , who had also starred in Desperado , playing the title role . TriStar and Amblin had been surprised by Rodriguez 's low - budget filming techniques for his action films , El Mariachi and Desperado , and shifted away from their initial plans with Salomon to make a big - budget version of Zorro . Spielberg had hoped Rodriguez would start filming in January 1996 for a Christmas release date , but the start date was pushed back to July . The release date was later moved to Easter 1997 . Rodriguez pulled out of the film ' in June 1996 over difficulties coming to terms with TriStar on the budget . The studio projected a range of $35 million , while Rodriguez wanted $45 million . They both attempted to compromise when Rodriguez lowered it to $42 million , but the studio refused and set $41 million as their highest mark . Banderas remained with the production , and Martin Campbell signed on later that month , turning down the chance to direct Tomorrow Never Dies . The finished screenplay would be written by John Eskow , Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio , based on a story by Elliott , Rossio , and Randall Jahnson .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_13314-14278	On January 24 , 2001 , Sony Pictures Entertainment filed a lawsuit in United States District Court , Central District of California , Western Division , against Fireworks Entertainment Group , the producers of the syndicated television series Queen of Swords . Sony alleged copyright infringement and other claims , saying the series `` copied protectable elements from ( the ) ' Zorro ' character and ' Zorro ' related works '' . On April 5 , 2001 , U.S. District Judge Collins denied Sony 's motion for a preliminary injunction , noting `` that since the copyrights in ( Johnson McCulley 's 1919 short story ) The Curse of Capistrano and ( the 1920 movie ) The Mark of Zorro lapsed in 1995 or before , the character Zorro has been in the public domain . '' As to specific elements of The Mask of Zorro , the judge found that any similarities between the film and the TV series ' secondary characters and plot elements were insufficient to warrant an injunction .

856872117_15643-16659	The Mask of Zorro and its sequel The Legend of Zorro incorporate certain historical events and people into their narrative . Antonio Banderas ' character , Alejandro Murrieta , is a fictional brother of Joaquin Murrieta , a real Mexican outlaw who was killed by the California State Rangers led by Harry Love ( portrayed in the film as Texas Army Captain `` Harrison Love '' ) in 1853 . The confrontation in the film takes place more than a decade earlier , in 1841 . The capture of Murrieta 's right - hand man Three - Fingered Jack by Love was also historical ; however , the real person was a Mexican named Manuel Garcia rather than an Anglo - American . As he did in the movie , the actual Harry Love preserved both Murrieta 's head and Jack 's hand in large , alcohol - filled glass jars . The opening sequence is set during the aftermath of the Mexican War of Independence , and an original ending on the DVD includes an appearance by Antonio López de Santa Anna , who is only mentioned in the finished film .

856872117_16677-17325	The Mask of Zorro was initially set for release on December 19 , 1997 before the release date was changed to March 1998 . There was speculation within the media about whether TriStar changed the date in an attempt to avoid competition with Titanic . In reality Zorro had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule . In addition , Sony Pictures Entertainment , TriStar 's parent company , wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998 . The release date was once again pushed back , this time to July 1998 , when pick - ups were commissioned . The delay from March to July added $3 million in interest costs .	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_17326-17875	To market Zorro , TriStar purchased a 30 - second advertising spot at Super Bowl XXXII for $1.3 million . Sony , who had been known for their low - key presence at the ShoWest trade show , showed clips from the film , while actors Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins presented a panel at the conference on May 10 , 1998 . The studio also attached Zorro 's trailer to prints of Godzilla . Sony launched an official website in June 1998 . Internet marketing was an emerging concept in the late - 1990s , and Zorro was Sony 's first film to use VRML .	The Mask of Zorro

856872117_18763-19922	Richard Schickel of Time magazine praised Zorro as a summer blockbuster which paid tribute to the classical Hollywood swashbuckler films . `` The action in this movie , most of which takes the form of spectacular stunt work performed by real , as opposed to digitized , people , '' Schickel stated , `` is motivated by simple , powerful emotions of an old - fashioned and rather melodramatic nature . '' Zorro exceeded Roger Ebert 's expectations , who was surprised by the screenplay 's display of traditional film craftsmanship . `` It 's a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories , rather than the other way around . '' Ebert later called The Mask of Zorro `` probably the best Zorro movie ever made . '' Despite giving credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro , Mick LaSalle , writing in the San Francisco Chronicle , found that the actor 's `` performance presents a slight problem : The film asks us to believe that no one has figured out that Zorro and his real - life persona are the same person , even though they are the only guys in Mexico who talk with a British accent . ''	The Mask of Zorro
856872117_19923-21351	Todd McCarthy of Variety found the film 's length to be `` somewhat overlong '' and lacking `` the snap and concision that would have put it over the top as a bang - up entertainment , but it 's closer in spirit to a vintage Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power swashbuckler than anything that 's come out of Hollywood in quite some time . '' In his review for Rolling Stone magazine , Peter Travers criticized the casting choices for the Mexican roles , which included Banderas , a Spaniard , as well as Hopkins and Zeta - Jones , who are both Welsh . Disappointed with the film 's entertainment value , Travers also expected the film to be a failure with audiences . Internet reviewer James Berardinelli compared the tone and style of The Mask of Zorro to producer Steven Spielberg 's Raiders of the Lost Ark . `` While The Mask of Zorro is n't on the same level , it 's not an altogether ridiculous comparison . Even though Zorro does n't feature the non-stop cliffhanger adventure of Raiders , '' Berardinelli continued , `` there 's still plenty of action , tumult , and derring - do . '' He was undecided whether the film would be a box office success , and that it would depend on the on - screen chemistry between Banderas and Zeta - Jones . In one of the film 's most popular scenes , Alejandro renders Eléna topless with a flurry of sword slashes . One critic placed it on his list of `` Erotic ( Film ) Scenes in the 90s '' .

856872117_12576-13789	The principal photography for the film began in Mexico on January 27 , 1997 on a $60 million budget . The Mask of Zorro was mostly shot at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City . Production stalled for four days in February when the director , Martin Campbell , was hospitalized for bronchitis . Filming resumed in Tlaxcala , three hours east of Mexico City , where the production crew constructed the Montero hacienda and town set pieces . Sony sent David Foster to join the project as a producer to help fill the void left by Steven Spielberg , Walter F. Parkes , and Laurie MacDonald , who were busy running DreamWorks . Foster and David S. Ward , who went uncredited , re-wrote some scenes ; the troubled production caused The Mask of Zorro to go $10 million over its budget . In December , the producers were frustrated by customs agents when some props and other items , including Zorro 's plastic sword , were held for nine days . During the post-production phase , Spielberg and Campbell decided that Diego de la Vega 's death in the arms of his daughter was too depressing . The ending , where Alejandro and Eléna are happily married with their infant son , was added three months after filming had ended .	The Mask of Zorro

838260565_1289-1824	The Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus , dated to about 1800 BC , deals with women 's complaints -- gynaecological diseases , fertility , pregnancy , contraception , etc . The text is divided into thirty - four sections , each section dealing with a specific problem and containing diagnosis and treatment ; no prognosis is suggested . Treatments are non surgical , comprising applying medicines to the affected body part or swallowing them . The womb is at times seen as the source of complaints manifesting themselves in other body parts .	Gynaecology
838260565_1825-2404	The Hippocratic Corpus contains several gynaecological treatises dating to the 5th / 4th centuries BC . Aristotle is another strong source for medical texts from the 4th century BC with his descriptions of biology primarily found in History of Animals , Parts of Animals , Generation of Animals . The gynaecological treatise Gynaikeia by Soranus of Ephesus ( 1st / 2nd century AD ) is extant ( together with a 6th - century Latin paraphrase by Muscio , a physician of the same school ) . He was the chief representative of the school of physicians known as the `` Methodists '' .	Gynaecology
838260565_2405-3537	J. Marion Sims is widely considered the father of modern gynaecology . Now criticized for the short comings . He developed some of his techniques by operating on slaves , many of whom were not given anaesthesia . Sims performed surgeries on 12 enslaved women in his homemade backyard hospital for four years . While performing the surgeries he invited men physicians and students to come watch the invasive and painful surgeries while the women were exposed . On one of the women , named Anarcha , he performed 13 surgeries and without anesthesia . Due to having so many enslaved women he would rotate from one to another continuous trying to perfect the repairment of fistulas . In the four years he performed these surgeries the physicians and students lost interest in assisting him . Due to this he got the other enslaved women , who were healing from their surgeries , to assist him in the operations , which required them to help in the performance of these painful surgeries on the other women . In 1855 Sims went on to found the Woman 's Hospital in New York , this was the first hospital specifically for female disorders .	Gynaecology
838260565_3898-4516	In some countries , women must first see a general practitioner ( GP ; also known as a family practitioner ( FP ) ) prior to seeing a gynaecologist . If their condition requires training , knowledge , surgical procedure , or equipment unavailable to the GP , the patient is then referred to a gynaecologist . In the United States , however , law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care in addition to aspects of their own specialty . With this option available , some women opt to see a gynaecological surgeon for non-gynaecological problems without another physician 's referral .	Gynaecology
838260565_4517-5555	As in all of medicine , the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination . Gynaecological examination is quite intimate , more so than a routine physical exam . It also requires unique instrumentation such as the speculum . The speculum consists of two hinged blades of concave metal or plastic which are used to retract the tissues of the vagina and permit examination of the cervix , the lower part of the uterus located within the upper portion of the vagina . Gynaecologists typically do a bimanual examination ( one hand on the abdomen and one or two fingers in the vagina ) to palpate the cervix , uterus , ovaries and bony pelvis . It is not uncommon to do a rectovaginal examination for complete evaluation of the pelvis , particularly if any suspicious masses are appreciated . Male gynaecologists may have a female chaperone for their examination . An abdominal or vaginal ultrasound can be used to confirm any abnormalities appreciated with the bimanual examination or when indicated by the patient 's history .	Gynaecology

838260565_6331-6939	As with all surgical specialties , gynaecologists may employ medical or surgical therapies ( or many times , both ) , depending on the exact nature of the problem that they are treating . Pre - and post-operative medical management will often employ many standard drug therapies , such as antibiotics , diuretics , antihypertensives , and antiemetics . Additionally , gynaecologists make frequent use of specialized hormone - modulating therapies ( such as Clomifene citrate and hormonal contraception ) to treat disorders of the female genital tract that are responsive to pituitary or gonadal signals . For	Gynaecology
838260565_7045-7988	Surgery , however , is the mainstay of gynaecological therapy . For historical and political reasons , gynaecologists were previously not considered `` surgeons '' , although this point has always been the source of some controversy . Modern advancements in both general surgery and gynaecology , however , have blurred many of the once rigid lines of distinction . The rise of sub-specialties within gynaecology which are primarily surgical in nature ( for example urogynaecology and gynaecological oncology ) have strengthened the reputations of gynaecologists as surgical practitioners , and many surgeons and surgical societies have come to view gynaecologists as comrades of sorts . As proof of this changing attitude , gynaecologists are now eligible for fellowship in both the American College of Surgeons and Royal Colleges of Surgeons , and many newer surgical textbooks include chapters on ( at least basic ) gynaecological surgery .

838260565_10369-10917	Despite the patients being predominantly female , like all specialist areas of health , historically gynaecology has been dominated by male doctors . However , in recent times as many of the barriers to access the education and training required to successfully practice gynaecology were removed , women have started to outnumber men in the field . There are a number of reasons for this , ranging from women being motivated to become gynaecologists after having bad experiences with male doctors to men choosing to specialize in different fields .	Gynaecology
838260565_10918-11372	Possible reasons reported for the decrease in male gynaecologists range from there being a perception of a lack of respect from other doctors towards them , distrust about their motivations for wanting to work exclusively with female sexual organs and questions about their overall character , as well as a concern about being associated with other male gynaecologists who have been arrested for sex offences and limited future employment opportunities .	Gynaecology
838260565_11373-11942	Surveys have also shown a large and consistent majority of women are uncomfortable being forced to have intimate exams done by a male doctor . They are also less likely to be embarrassed , so as a result talk more openly and in greater details , when discussing their sexual history with another woman rather than a man , leading to questions about the ability of male gynaecologists to offer quality care to patients . This , when coupled with more women choosing female physicians has decreased the employment opportunities for men choosing to become gynaecologists .	Gynaecology
838260565_11943-12505	In the United States , it has been reported that 4 in 5 students choosing a residency in gynaecology are now female . In Sweden , to comply with discrimination laws , patients may not choose a doctor -- irregardless of specialty -- based on factors such as ethnicity or gender and declining to see a doctor solely because of preference regarding e.g. the practitioner 's skin color or gender may legally be viewed as refusing care . In Turkey , due to patient preference to be seen by another female , there are now few male gynaecologists working in the field .	Gynaecology
838260565_12506-13209	There have been a number of legal challenges in the US against healthcare providers who have started hiring based on gender of physicians . Dr Mircea Veleanu argued , in part , that his former employers discriminated against him by accommodating the wishes of female patients who had requested female doctors for intimate exams . A male nurse complained about an advert for an all - female obstetrics and gynaecology practice in Columbia , Maryland claiming this was a form of sexual discrimination . Dr David Garfinkel , a New Jersey - based ob - gyn sued his former employer after being fired due to , as he claimed , `` because I was male , I was n't drawing as many patients as they 'd expected '' .

838260565_13210-13537	So far , all legal challenges by male gynaecologists to remove patient choice have failed due to there being protection in law for ' bona fide occupational qualification ' which in previous cases involving wash - room attendants and male nurses have recognized a justification for gender - based requirements for certain jobs .

831327308_489-835	`` Bye and Bye We 're ( or , I 'm ) Going to See the King '' is a Christian song from the African - American musical tradition . It is known by a variety of titles , including `` I Would n't Mind Dying ( If Dying Was All ) '' and `` A Mother 's Last Word to Her Daughter '' . It was recorded seven times before 1930 , using the preceding titles .	Bye and Bye We're Going to See the King
831327308_836-944	It has been most often recorded in gospel or gospel blues style , but also in other styles such as country .	Bye and Bye We're Going to See the King
831327308_1049-1725	The song consists of several four - line verses ( quatrains ) and a repeated refrain . The words both of verses and of refrain often differ from one artist to another . A standard feature is that the refrain consists of four lines , the first three of which are identical . Common variants of those three lines include `` Bye and bye we 're ( or , I 'm ) going to see the King '' and `` Holy , holy , holy is His name '' . The fourth line almost always begins `` ( I ) would n't ( or , do n't ) mind dying '' . It concludes in various ways in different versions , for example `` If dying was all '' , or `` But I got ta go by myself '' , or `` Because I 'm a child of God '' .

838217921_202-669	In economics , the demand curve is the graph depicting the relationship between the price of a certain commodity and the amount of it that consumers are willing and able to purchase at any given price . It is a graphic representation of a market demand schedule . The demand curve for all consumers together follows from the demand curve of every individual consumer : the individual demands at each price are added together , assuming independent decision - making .	Demand curve
838217921_670-1247	Demand curves are used to estimate behaviors in competitive markets , and are often combined with supply curves to estimate the equilibrium price ( the price at which sellers together are willing to sell the same amount as buyers together are willing to buy , also known as market clearing price ) and the equilibrium quantity ( the amount of that good or service that will be produced and bought without surplus / excess supply or shortage / excess demand ) of that market . In a monopolistic market , the demand curve facing the monopolist is simply the market demand curve .	Demand curve
838217921_1248-1434	Demand curves are usually considered as theoretical structures that are expected to exist in the real world , but real world measurements of actual demand curves are difficult and rare .	Demand curve
838217921_1807-2003	According to convention , the demand curve is drawn with price on the vertical ( y ) axis and quantity on the horizontal ( x ) axis . The function actually plotted is the inverse demand function .	Demand curve
838217921_2004-2567	The demand curve usually slopes downwards from left to right ; that is , it has a negative association . The negative slope is often referred to as the `` law of demand '' , which means people will buy more of a service , product , or resource as its price falls . The demand curve is related to the marginal utility curve , since the price one is willing to pay depends on the utility . However , the demand directly depends on the income of an individual while the utility does not . Thus it may change indirectly due to change in demand for other commodities .	Demand curve
838217921_2568-2965	However , with Veblen goods , such as status symbols , the utility value of the good is largely the price and demand is higher at higher prices and the demand curve may curve upwards . With a Giffen good the price is taken by the market as a signal of quality , irrespective of the true nature of the product , and hence demand may be very low when priced low and increase at higher price points .	Demand curve
838217921_2995-3505	The demand curve is often graphed as a straight line of the form Q = a − bP where a and b are parameters . The constant `` a '' embodies the effects of all factors other than price that affect demand . If income were to change , for example , the effect of the change would be represented by a change in the value of `` a '' and be reflected graphically as a shift of the demand curve . The constant `` b '' is the slope of the demand curve and shows how the price of the good affects the quantity demanded .	Demand curve
838217921_3506-3748	The graph of the demand curve uses the inverse demand function in which price is expressed as a function of quantity . The standard form of the demand equation can be converted to the inverse equation by solving for P or P = a / b − Q / b .	Demand curve
838217921_3749-3976	More plainly , in the equation P = a − bQ , `` a '' is the intercept where price is zero ( where the demand curve intercepts the X-axis ) , `` b '' is the slope of the demand curve , `` Q '' is quantity and `` P '' is price .	Demand curve
838217921_3977-4617	There is movement along a demand curve when a change in price causes the quantity demanded to change . It is important to distinguish between movement along a demand curve , and a shift in a demand curve . Movements along a demand curve happen only when the price of the good changes . When a non-price determinant of demand changes the curve shifts . These `` other variables '' are part of the demand function . They are `` merely lumped into intercept term of a simple linear demand function . '' Thus a change in a non-price determinant of demand is reflected in a change in the x-intercept causing the curve to shift along the x axis .	Demand curve
838217921_4633-5540	The shift of a demand curve takes place when there is a change in any non-price determinant of demand , resulting in a new demand curve . Non-price determinants of demand are those things that will cause demand to change even if prices remain the same -- in other words , the things whose changes might cause a consumer to buy more or less of a good even if the good 's own price remained unchanged . Some of the more important factors are the prices of related goods ( both substitutes and complements ) , income , population , and expectations . However , demand is the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a good under the prevailing circumstances ; so , any circumstance that affects the consumer 's willingness or ability to buy the good or service in question can be a non-price determinant of demand . As an example , weather could be a factor in the demand for beer at a baseball game .	Demand curve
838217921_5541-6240	When income increases , the demand curve for normal goods shifts outward as more will be demanded at all prices , while the demand curve for inferior goods shifts inward due to the increased attainability of superior substitutes . With respect to related goods , when the price of a good ( e.g. a hamburger ) rises , the demand curve for substitute goods ( e.g. chicken ) shifts out , while the demand curve for complementary goods ( e.g. tomato sauce ) shifts in ( i.e. there is more demand for substitute goods as they become more attractive in terms of value for money , while demand for complementary goods contracts in response to the contraction of quantity demanded of the underlying good ) .	Demand curve
838217921_6266-6905	Changes in disposable income , the magnitude of the shift also being related to the income elasticity of demand . Changes in tastes and preferences -- tastes and preferences are assumed to be fixed in the short - run . This assumption of fixed preferences is a necessary condition for aggregation of individual demand curves to derive market demand . Changes in expectations . Changes in the prices of related goods ( substitutes and complements ) Population size and composition N.B. Whilst variations in the price of the actual product affects the overall quantity demanded , economists do not consider price to affect the demand curve .	Demand curve

838217921_7096-7330	Market or aggregate demand is the summation of individual demand curves . In addition to the factors which can affect individual demand there are three factors that can affect market demand ( cause the market demand curve to shift ) :	Demand curve
838217921_7331-7504	a change in the number of consumers , a change in the distribution of tastes among consumers , a change in the distribution of income among consumers with different tastes .	Demand curve

838217921_7772-8412	There is movement along a demand curve when a change in price causes the quantity demanded to change . It is important to distinguish between movement along a demand curve , and a shift in a demand curve . Movements along a demand curve happen only when the price of the good changes . When a non-price determinant of demand changes the curve shifts . These `` other variables '' are part of the demand function . They are `` merely lumped into intercept term of a simple linear demand function . '' Thus a change in a non-price determinant of demand is reflected in a change in the x-intercept causing the curve to shift along the x axis .	Demand curve
838217921_8446-8742	If a commodity is sold in whole units , and these are valuable for a consumer , then the individual demand curve can hardly be approximated by a continuous curve . It is a set function of the price , defined by a price above which no unit is bought , a price range for which one is bought , etc .	Demand curve
838217921_8770-9074	If the local currency is dollars , for example , then the units of measurement of the variable `` price '' are `` dollars per unit of the good '' and the units of measurement of `` quantity '' are `` units of the good per time ( e.g. , per week or per year ) . Thus quantity demanded is a flow variable .	Demand curve
838217921_9161-9449	PED is a measure of the sensitivity of the quantity variable , Q , to changes in the price variable , P. Elasticity answers the question of how much the quantity will change in percentage terms for a 1 % change in the price , and is thus important in determining how revenue will change .	Demand curve
838217921_9450-9998	The elasticity of demand indicates how sensitive the demand for a good is to a price change . If the PED is between zero and 1 , demand is said to be inelastic ; if PED equals 1 , the demand is unitary elastic ; and if the Price elasticity of demand is greater than 1 , demand is elastic . A low coefficient implies that changes in price have little influence on demand . A high elasticity indicates that consumers will respond to a price rise by buying a lot less of the good and that consumers will respond to a price cut by buying a lot more ...	Demand curve
838217921_10028-10336	A sales tax on the commodity does not directly change the demand curve , if the price axis in the graph represents the price including tax .

838217921_10337-10548	If the price axis in the graph represents the price before addition of tax and / or subtraction of subsidy then the demand curve moves inward when a tax is introduced , and outward when a subsidy is introduced .	Demand curve

818564963_138-1074	A smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently . This includes data collected from citizens , devices , and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems , power plants , water supply networks , waste management , law enforcement , information systems , schools , libraries , hospitals , and other community services . The smart city concept integrates information and communication technology ( ICT ) , and various physical devices connected to the network ( the Internet of things or IoT ) to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens . Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving .	Smart city
818564963_1075-1646	Information and communication technology ( ICT ) is used to enhance quality , performance and interactivity of urban services , to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government . Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real - time responses . A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a simple `` transactional '' relationship with its citizens . Yet , the term itself remains unclear to its specifics and therefore , open to many interpretations .	Smart city
818564963_1647-1901	Other terms that have been used for similar concepts include cyberville , digital city , electronic communities , flexicity , information city , intelligent city , knowledge - based city , MESH city , telecity , teletopia , Ubiquitous city , wired city .	Smart city
818564963_1902-2855	Major technological , economic and environmental changes have generated interest in smart cities , including climate change , economic restructuring , the move to online retail and entertainment , ageing populations , urban population growth and pressures on public finances . The European Union ( EU ) has devoted constant efforts to devising a strategy for achieving ' smart ' urban growth for its metropolitan city - regions . The EU has developed a range of programmes under ' Europe 's Digital Agenda `` . In 2010 , it highlighted its focus on strengthening innovation and investment in ICT services for the purpose of improving public services and quality of life . Arup estimates that the global market for smart urban services will be $400 billion per annum by 2020 . Examples of Smart City technologies and programs have been implemented in Dubai , Milton Keynes , Southampton , Amsterdam , Barcelona , Madrid , Stockholm , China and New York .	Smart city
818564963_3441-3686	Due to the breadth of technologies that have been implemented under the smart city label , it is difficult to distill a precise definition of a smart city . Deakin and Al Wear list four factors that contribute to the definition of a smart city :	Smart city
818564963_3687-4087	The application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to communities and cities The use of ICT to transform life and working environments within the region The embedding of such Information and Communications Technologies ( ICTs ) in government systems The territorialisation of practices that brings ICTs and people together to enhance the innovation and knowledge that they offer .	Smart city
818564963_4088-4479	Deakin defines the smart city as one that utilises ICT to meet the demands of the market ( the citizens of the city ) , and that community involvement in the process is necessary for a smart city . A smart city would thus be a city that not only possesses ICT technology in particular areas , but has also implemented this technology in a manner that positively impacts the local community .	Smart city
818564963_4514-6660	Giffinger et al. 2007 : `` Regional competitiveness , transport and Information and Communication Technologies economics , natural resources , human and social capital , quality of life , and participation of citizens in the governance of cities . '' Smart Cities Council : `` A smart city is one that has digital technology embedded across all city functions . '' Caragliu and Nijkamp 2009 : `` A city can be defined as ' smart ' when investments in human and social capital and traditional ( transport ) and modern ( ICT ) communication infrastructure fuel sustainable economic development and a high quality of life , with a wise management of natural resources , through participatory action and engagement . '' Frost & Sullivan 2014 : `` We identified eight key aspects that define a Smart City : smart governance , smart energy , smart building , smart mobility , smart infrastructure , smart technology , smart healthcare and smart citizen . '' Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Smart Cities : `` A smart city brings together technology , government and society to enable the following characteristics : smart cities , a smart economy , smart mobility , a smart environment , smart people , smart living , smart governance . '' Business Dictionary : `` A developed urban area that creates sustainable economic development and high quality of life by excelling in multiple key areas ; economy , mobility , environment , people , living , and government . Excelling in these key areas can be done so through strong human capital , social capital , and / or ICT infrastructure . '' Indian Government 2014 : `` Smart City offers sustainability in terms of economic activities and employment opportunities to a wide section of its residents , regardless of their level of education , skills or income levels . '' Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , UK 2013 : `` The concept is not static , there is no absolute definition of a smart city , no end point , but rather a process , or series of steps , by which cities become more ' liveable ' and resilient and , hence , able to respond quicker to new challenges . ''	Smart city
818564963_6686-6830	It has been suggested that a smart city ( also community , business cluster , urban agglomeration or region ) uses information technologies to :	Smart city
818564963_6831-7489	Make more efficient use of physical infrastructure ( roads , built environment and other physical assets ) through artificial intelligence and data analytics to support a strong and healthy economic , social , cultural development . Engage effectively with local people in local governance and decision by use of open innovation processes and e-participation , improving the collective intelligence of the city 's institutions through e-governance , with emphasis placed on citizen participation and co-design . Learn , adapt and innovate and thereby respond more effectively and promptly to changing circumstances by improving the intelligence of the city .	Smart city
818564963_7490-7939	They evolve towards a strong integration of all dimensions of human intelligence , collective intelligence , and also artificial intelligence within the city . The intelligence of cities `` resides in the increasingly effective combination of digital telecommunication networks ( the nerves ) , ubiquitously embedded intelligence ( the brains ) , sensors and tags ( the sensory organs ) , and software ( the knowledge and cognitive competence ) '' .	Smart city
818564963_7940-8032	These forms of intelligence in smart cities have been demonstrated in three ways : Bletchley	Smart city
818564963_8089-9521	Orchestration intelligence : Where cities establish institutions and community - based problem solving and collaborations , such as in Bletchley Park , where the Nazi Enigma cypher was decoded by a team led by Alan Turing . This has been referred to as the first example of a smart city or an intelligent community . Empowerment intelligence : Cities provide open platforms , experimental facilities and smart city infrastructure in order to cluster innovation in certain districts . These are seen in the Kista Science City in Stockholm and the Cyberport Zone in Hong Kong . Similar facilities have also been established in Melbourne . Hong Kong Cyberport 1 and Cyberport 2 Buildings Instrumentation intelligence : Where city infrastructure is made smart through real - time data collection , with analysis and predictive modelling across city districts . There is much controversy surrounding this , particularly with regards to surveillance issues in smart cities . Examples of Instrumentation intelligence have been implemented in Amsterdam . This is implemented through : A common IP infrastructure that is open to researchers to develop applications . Wireless meters and devices transmit information at the point in time . A number of homes being provided with smart energy meters to become aware of energy consumption and reduce energy usage Solar power garbage compactors , car recharging stations and energy saving lamps .

818564963_9961-10214	According to David K. Owens , the former executive vice president of the Edison Electric Institute , two key elements that a smart city must have are an integrated communications platform and a `` dynamic resilient grid . '' Both are large investments .	Smart city
818564963_10235-10444	In order to achieve an accurate description and explanation of the concept of Smart City it is needed to first analyse the topic through a specific framework . The framework is divided into 4 main dimensions :	Smart city
818564963_10475-10706	Several concepts of the Smart city rely heavily on the use of technology ; a technological Smart City is not just one concept but there are different combinations of technological infrastructure that build a concept of smart city .	Smart city
818564963_10707-11159	Digital city : it combines service oriented infrastructure , innovation services and communication infrastructure ; Yovanof , G.S. & Hazapis , G.N. define a digital city `` a connected community that combines broadband communications infrastructure ; a flexible , service - oriented computing infrastructure based on open industry standards ; and , innovative services to meet the needs of governments and their employees , citizens and businesses '' .	Smart city
818564963_11160-11293	The main purpose is to create an environment in which citizens are interconnected and easily share information anywhere in the city .	Smart city
818564963_11294-14044	Virtual city : In these kinds of cities functions are implemented in a cyberspace ; it includes the notion of hybrid city , which consists of a reality with real citizens and entities and a parallel virtual city of real entities and people . Have a smart city that is virtual means that in some cities it is possible the coexistence between these two reality , however the issue of physical distance and location is still not easy to manage . The vision of the world without distance still remains unmet in many ways . In practice this idea is hold up through physical IT infrastructure of cables , data centers , and exchanges . Information city : It collects local information and delivered them to the public portal ; In that city , many inhabitants are able to live and even work on the Internet because they could obtain every information through IT infrastructures , thanks to the sharing information method among citizens themselves . Using this approach , an information city could be an urban centre both economically and socially speaking ; the most important thing is the linkage among civic services , people interactions and government institutions . Intelligent city : it involves function as research or technological innovation to support learning and innovation procedure . The notion emerges in a social context in which knowledge , learning process and creativity have great importance and the human capital is considered the most precious resource within this type of technological city . In particular one of the most significant feature of an intelligent city is that every infrastructure is up to date , that means have the latest technology in telecommunications , electronic and mechanical technology . According to Komninos and Sefertzi , the attempt to build an `` intelligent '' Smart City is more a radical innovation rather than an incremental innovation owing to a big quantity of efforts to use IT trying to transform the daily life . Ubiquitous city ( U-city ) : It creates an environment that connect citizens to any services through any device . According to Anthopoulos , L. , & Fitsilis , P. , U-city is a further extension of digital city concept because of the facility in terms of accessibility to every infrastructure . This makes easier to the citizen the use of any available devices to interconnect them . Its goal is to create a city where any citizen can get any services anywhere and anytime through any kind of devices . It is important to highlights that the ubiquitous city is different from the above virtual city : while the virtual city creates another space by visualizing the real urban elements within the virtual space , U-city is given by the computer chips inserted to those urban elements .	Smart city
818564963_14070-14224	Human infrastructure ( i.e. , creative occupations and workforce , knowledge networks , voluntary organisations ) is a crucial axis for city development .	Smart city
818564963_14225-16417	Creative city : creativity is recognized as a key driver to smart city and it represents also a version of it . Social infrastructures , like for instance intellectual and social capital are indispensable factors to build a city that is smart according to the human framework . These infrastructures concern people and their relationship . Smart City benefits from social capital and it could be possible and easier to create a Smart city concept if there are mix of education and training , culture and arts , business and commerce as Bartlett , L. said . Learning city : according to Moser , M.A. , learning city is involved in building skilled workforce . This type of city in the human context improves the competitiveness in the global knowledge economy and Campbell ( 16 ) established a typology of cities that are learning to be smart : individually proactive city , city cluster , one - to - one link between cities , and city network . That lead a city to learn how it should be possible and realistic to be smart trough learning process followed by city workforce . Humane city : It exploits human potential , in particular the knowledge workforce . Following this approach , it is possible focus on education and builds a center of higher education , which is the city , obtaining better - educated individuals . According to Glaeser , E.L. , & Berry , C. R , this view moves a smart city concept in a city full of skilled workforces ; the same reasoning could be make for those high tech knowledge - sensitive industries which want to migrate in a so dynamic and proactive community . As a consequence of the above movement , the difference between Smart City and not are getting wider ; Smart places are getting smarter while other places getting less smarter because such places act as a magnet for creative people and workers ( Malanga , S. 2004 ) . Knowledge city : It is related to knowledge economy and innovation process ; this type of Smart City is very similar to a learning city , the only difference refers to `` a knowledge city is heavily related to knowledge economy , and its distinction is stress on innovation '' ( Dirks , S. , Gurdgiev , C. , & Keeling , M . ) .	Smart city
818564963_16418-16753	The concept of knowledge city is linked with similar evolving concepts of Smart City such as intelligent city and educating city . The most important feature of this city is the fundamental concept of knowledge - based urban development , which has become an important and widespread mechanism for the development of knowledge cities .	Smart city
818564963_16787-18223	According to Moser , M.A. , since 1990s the Smart Communities movement took shape as a strategy to broaden the base of users involved in IT . Members of these Communities are people that share their interest and work in a partnership with govern and other institutional organizations to push the use of IT to improve the quality of daily life as a consequence of different worsening in daily actions . Eger , J.M. said that a smart community makes a conscious and agreed - upon decision to deploy technology as a catalyst to solving its social and business needs . It is very important to understand that this use of IT and the consequent improvement could be more demanding without the institutional help ; indeed institutional involvement is essential to the success of smart community initiatives . Again Moser , M.A. explained that `` building and planning a smart community seeks for smart growth '' ; a smart growth is essential what the partnership between citizen and institutional organizations try to do that is a reaction to worsening trends in daily things , like for instance traffic congestion , school overcrowding and air pollution . However it is important noticed that technological propagation is not an end in itself , but only a means to reinventing cities for a new economy and society . To sum up , it could possible to assert that any Smart City initiatives necessitate the governance support for their success .	Smart city
818564963_18224-18654	The importance of these three different dimensions consist that only a link , correlation among them make possible a development of a real concept of Smart City . According to the definition of Smart City given by Caragliu , A. , Del Bo , C. , & Nijkamp , P. , a city is smart when investments in human / social capital and IT infrastructure fuel sustainable growth and enhance quality of life , through participatory governance .	Smart city
818564963_18681-19144	Smart cities use data and technology to create efficiencies , improve sustainability , create economic development , and enhance quality of life factors for people living and working in the city . It also means that the city has a smarter energy infrastructure . A more formal definition is this : `` ... An urban area that has securely integrated technology across the information ... and Internet of Things ( IoT ) sectors to better manage a city 's assets . ''	Smart city
818564963_19145-19661	A smart city is powered by `` smart connections '' for various items such as street lighting , smart buildings , distributed energy resources ( DER ) , data analytics , and smart transportation . Amongst these things , energy is paramount ; this is why utility companies play a key role in smart cities . Electric companies , working partnership with city officials , technology companies and a number of other institutions , are among the major players that helped accelerate the growth of America 's smart cities .

Smart city
818564963_20328-20593	In London , a traffic management system known as SCOOT optimises green light time at traffic intersections by feeding back magnetometer and inductive loop data to a supercomputer , which can co-ordinate traffic lights across the city to improve traffic throughout .	Smart city
818564963_20594-21059	The city of Santander in Cantabria , northern Spain , has 20,000 sensors connecting buildings , infrastructure , transport , networks and utilities , offers a physical space for experimentation and validation of the IoT functions , such as interaction and management protocols , device technologies , and support services such as discovery , identity management and security In Santander , the sensors monitor the levels of pollution , noise , traffic and parking .	Smart city
818564963_21060-21568	Electronic cards ( known as smart cards ) are another common platform in smart city contexts . These cards possess a unique encrypted identifier that allows the owner to log into a range of government provided services ( or e-services ) without setting up multiple accounts . The single identifier allows governments to aggregate data about citizens and their preferences to improve the provision of services and to determine common interests of groups . This technology has been implemented in Southampton .	Smart city

818564963_21900-23019	Define exactly what is the community : maybe that definition can condition what you are doing in the subsequent steps ; it relates to geography , links between cities and countryside and flows of people between them ; maybe -- even -- that in some Countries the definition of City / community that is stated does not correspond effectively to what -- in fact -- happens in the real life Study The Community : Before deciding to build a smart city , first we need to know why . This can be done by determining the benefits of such an initiative . Study the community to know the citizens , the business 's needs -- know the citizens and the community 's unique attributes , such as the age of the citizens , their education , hobbies , and attractions of the city . Develop a Smart City Policy : Develop a policy to drive the initiatives , where roles , responsibilities , objective , and goals , can be defined . Create plans and strategies on how the goals will be achieved . Engage The Citizens : This can be done by engaging the citizens through the use of e-government initiatives , open data , sport events , etc .	Smart city
818564963_23020-23576	In short , People , Processes , and Technology ( PPT ) are the three principles of the success of a smart city initiative . Cities must study their citizens and communities , know the processes , business drivers , create policies , and objectives to meet the citizens ' needs . Then , technology can be implemented to meet the citizens ' need , in order to improve the quality of life and create real economic opportunities. This requires a holistic customized approach that accounts for city cultures , long - term city planning , and local regulations .	Smart city

There are a number of cities actively pursuing a smart city strategy :	Smart city
818564963_26927-28303	The Amsterdam Smart City initiative which began in 2009 currently includes 170 + projects collaboratively developed by local residents , government and businesses . These projects run on an interconnected platform through wireless devices to enhance the city 's real time decision making abilities . The City of Amsterdam ( City ) claims the purpose of the projects is to reduce traffic , save energy and improve public safety . To promote efforts from local residents , the City runs the Amsterdam Smart City Challenge annually , accepting proposals for applications and developments that fit within the City 's framework . An example of a resident developed app is Mobypark , which allows owners of parking spaces to rent them out to people for a fee . The data generated from this app can then be used by the City to determine parking demand and traffic flows in Amsterdam . A number of homes have also been provided with smart energy meters , with incentives provided to those that actively reduce energy consumption . Other initiatives include flexible street lighting ( smart lighting ) which allows municipalities to control the brightness of street lights , and smart traffic management where traffic is monitored in real time by the City and information about current travel time on certain roads is broadcast to allow motorists to determine the best routes to take .	Smart city
818564963_28405-29533	Barcelona has established a number of projects that can be considered ' smart city ' applications within its `` CityOS '' strategy . For example , sensor technology has been implemented in the irrigation system in Parc del Centre de Poblenou , where real time data is transmitted to gardening crews about the level of water required for the plants . Barcelona has also designed a new bus network based on data analysis of the most common traffic flows in Barcelona , utilising primarily vertical , horizontal and diagonal routes with a number of interchanges . Integration of multiple smart city technologies can be seen through the implementation of smart traffic lights as buses run on routes designed to optimise the number of green lights . In addition , where an emergency is reported in Barcelona , the approximate route of the emergency vehicle is entered into the traffic light system , setting all the lights to green as the vehicle approaches through a mix of GPS and traffic management software , allowing emergency services to reach the incident without delay . Much of this data is managed by the Sentilo Platform .	Smart city
818564963_29559-30183	In the summer of 2017 , the City of Columbus , Ohio began its pursuit of a smart city initiative . It partnered with American Electric Power Ohio to create a group of new electric vehicle charging stations . Many smart cities such as Columbus are using agreements such as this one to prepare for climate change , expand electric infrastructure , convert existing public vehicle fleets to electric cars , and create incentives for people to share rides when commuting . For doing this , the U.S. Department of Transportation gave the City of Columbus a $40 million grant . The city also received $10 million from Vulcan Inc .	Smart city
818564963_30184-30579	One key reason why the utility was involved in the picking of locations for new electric vehicle charging stations was to gather data .

818564963_31252-32164	PLANET is a project which has been designed by professionals , experts in urban planning and ' smart utilities ' , and a project characterised by developments in the Smart City concept . The ' smart ' city is now becoming more inclusive , opening up to a new target : low - medium income brackets . One of the universal concepts key to the Smart City project is its eco-sustainability : PLANET extends this concept strategically at an economic level . The sustainability of the costs and the investments becomes an essential priority of the ' Social Smart City ' . PLANET creates and implements this project while staying within the economic parameters imposed by government Social Housing programs ( Brazilian Minha Casa , Minha Vida ) . The Smart City does not need to be close to a pre-existing city : it is a new autonomous and functional city and , as such , it can attract both individuals and businesses .	Smart city
818564963_32181-32948	Madrid , Spain 's pioneering smart city , has adopted the MiNT Madrid Inteligente / Smarter Madrid platform to integrate the management of local services . These include the sustainable and computerized management of infrastructure , garbage collection and recycling , and public spaces and green areas , among others . The programme is run in partnership with IBMs INSA , making use of the latter 's Big Data and analytics capabilities and experience . Madrid is considered to have taken a bottom - up approach to smart cities , whereby social issues are first identified and individual technologies or networks are then identified to address these issues . This approach includes support and recognition for start ups through the Madrid Digital Start Up programme .	Smart city
818564963_32969-33177	In December 2015 , Manchester 's CityVerve project was chosen as the winner of a government - led technology competition and awarded £ 10m to develop an Internet of Things ( IoT ) smart cities demonstrator .	Smart city
818564963_33178-33397	Established in July 2016 , the project is being carried out by a consortium of 22 public and private organisations , including Manchester City Council , and is aligned with the city 's on - going devolution commitment .	Smart city
818564963_33398-33661	The project has a two - year remit to demonstrate the capability of IoT applications and address barriers to deploying smart cities , such as city governance , network security , user trust and adoption , interoperability , scalability and justifying investment .	Smart city
818564963_33662-34027	CityVerve is based on an open data principle that incorporates a ' platform of platforms ' which ties together applications for its four key themes : transport and travel ; health and social care ; energy and the environment ; culture and the public realm . This will also ensure that the project is scalable and able to be redeployed to other locations worldwide .	Smart city
818564963_34051-34865	Milton Keynes has a commitment to making itself a Smart City . Currently the mechanism through which this is approached is the MK : Smart initiative , a collaboration of local government , businesses , academia and 3rd sector organisations . The focus of the initiative is on making energy use , water use and transport more sustainable whilst promoting economic growth in the city . Central to the project is the creation of a state - of - the - art ' MK Data Hub ' which will support the acquisition and management of vast amounts of data relevant to city systems from a variety of data sources . These will include data about energy and water consumption , transport data , data acquired through satellite technology , social and economic datasets , and crowdsourced data from social media or specialised apps .	Smart city
818564963_34866-35479	The MK : Smart initiative has two aspects which extend our understanding of how Smart Cities should operate . The first , Our MK , is a scheme for promoting citizen - led sustainability issues in the city . The scheme provides funding and support to engage with citizens and help turn their ideas around sustainability into a reality . The second aspect is in providing citizens with the skills to operate effectively in a Smart City . The Urban Data school is an online platform to teach school students about data skills while the project has also produced a MOOC to inform citizens about what a Smart City is .	Smart city
818564963_35587-36183	The city of San Leandro , California is in the midst of transforming from an industrial center to a tech hub of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) ( technology that lets devices communicate with each other over the Internet ) . California 's utility company PG&E is working with the city in this endeavor and on a smart energy pilot program that would develop a distributed energy network across the city that would be monitored by IoT sensors . The goal would be to give the city an energy system that has enough capacity to receive and redistribute electricity to and from multiple energy sources .	Smart city
818564963_36204-36849	An alternative use of smart city technology can be found in Santa Cruz , California , where local authorities analyse historical crime data in order to predict police requirements and maximise police presence where it is required . The analytical tools generate a list of 10 places each day where property crimes are more likely to occur , and then placing police efforts on these regions when officers are not responding to any emergency . This use of ICT technology is different to the manner in which European cities utilise smart city technology , possibly highlighting the breadth of the smart city concept in different parts of the world .

818564963_37706-38926	Stockholm 's smart city technology is underpinned by the Stokab dark fibre system which was developed in 1994 to provide a universal fibre optic network across Stockholm . Private companies are able to lease fibre as service providers on equal terms . The company is owned by the City of Stockholm itself . Within this framework , Stockholm has created a Green IT strategy . The Green IT program seeks to reduce the environmental impact of Stockholm through IT functions such as energy efficient buildings ( minimising heating costs ) , traffic monitoring ( minimising the time spent on the road ) and development of e-services ( minimising paper usage ) . The e-Stockholm platform is centred on the provision of e-services , including political announcements , parking space booking and snow clearance . This is further being developed through GPS analytics , allowing residents to plan their route through the city . An example of district - specific smart city technology can be found in the Kista Science City region . This region is based on the triple helix concept of smart cities , where university , industry and government work together to develop ICT applications for implementation in a smart city strategy .	Smart city
818564963_39041-40299	A bias in strategic interest may lead to ignoring alternative avenues of promising urban development . A smart city , as a scientifically planned city , would defy the fact that real development in cities is often haphazard . In that line of criticism , the smart city is seen as unattractive for citizens as they `` can deaden and stupefy the people who live in its all - efficient embrace '' . Instead , people would prefer cities they can participate to shape . The focus of the concept of smart city may lead to an underestimation of the possible negative effects of the development of the new technological and networked infrastructures needed for a city to be smart . As a globalized business model is based on capital mobility , following a business - oriented model may result in a losing long term strategy : `` The ' spatial fix ' inevitably means that mobile capital can often ' write its own deals ' to come to town , only to move on when it receives a better deal elsewhere . This is no less true for the smart city than it was for the industrial , ( or ) manufacturing city . '' The high level of big data collection and analytics has raised questions regarding surveillance in smart cities , particularly as it relates to predictive policing .	Smart city
813681588_86-418	Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell - to - cell contact or by a bridge - like connection between two cells . It is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell - to - cell contact .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_419-901	Bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction or mating since it involves the exchange of genetic material . However , it is not sexual reproduction , since no exchange of gamete occurs . During conjugation the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon . Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the recipient cell does not already contain a similar element .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_902-1290	The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient . Benefits may include antibiotic resistance , xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites . Such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbionts . Other elements , however , may be viewed as bacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_1643-2009	Donor cell produces pilus . Pilus attaches to recipient cell and brings the two cells together . The mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of DNA is then transferred to the recipient cell . Both cells synthesize a complementary strand to produce a double stranded circular plasmid and also reproduce pili ; both cells are now viable donor for the F - factor .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_2010-2559	The F - plasmid is an episome ( a plasmid that can integrate itself into the bacterial chromosome by homologous recombination ) with a length of about 100 kb . It carries its own origin of replication , the oriV , and an origin of transfer , or oriT . There can only be one copy of the F - plasmid in a given bacterium , either free or integrated , and bacteria that possess a copy are called F - positive or F - plus ( denoted F ) . Cells that lack F plasmids are called F - negative or F - minus ( F ) and as such can function as recipient cells .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_2560-3449	Among other genetic information , the F - plasmid carries a tra and trb locus , which together are about 33 kb long and consist of about 40 genes . The tra locus includes the pilin gene and regulatory genes , which together form pili on the cell surface . The locus also includes the genes for the proteins that attach themselves to the surface of F bacteria and initiate conjugation . Though there is some debate on the exact mechanism of conjugation it seems that the pili are not the structures through which DNA exchange occurs . This has been shown in experiments where the pilus are allowed to make contact , but then are denatured with SDS and yet DNA transformation still proceeds . Several proteins coded for in the tra or trb locus seem to open a channel between the bacteria and it is thought that the traD enzyme , located at the base of the pilus , initiates membrane fusion .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_3450-4471	When conjugation is initiated by a signal the relaxase enzyme creates a nick in one of the strands of the conjugative plasmid at the oriT . Relaxase may work alone or in a complex of over a dozen proteins known collectively as a relaxosome . In the F - plasmid system the relaxase enzyme is called TraI and the relaxosome consists of TraI , TraY , TraM and the integrated host factor IHF . The nicked strand , or T - strand , is then unwound from the unbroken strand and transferred to the recipient cell in a 5 ' - terminus to 3 ' - terminus direction . The remaining strand is replicated either independent of conjugative action ( vegetative replication beginning at the oriV ) or in concert with conjugation ( conjugative replication similar to the rolling circle replication of lambda phage ) . Conjugative replication may require a second nick before successful transfer can occur . A recent report claims to have inhibited conjugation with chemicals that mimic an intermediate step of this second nicking event . 1.	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_5580-6161	If the F - plasmid that is transferred has previously been integrated into the donor 's genome ( producing an Hfr strain ( `` High Frequency of Recombination '' ) ) some of the donor 's chromosomal DNA may also be transferred with the plasmid DNA . The amount of chromosomal DNA that is transferred depends on how long the two conjugating bacteria remain in contact . In common laboratory strains of E. coli the transfer of the entire bacterial chromosome takes about 100 minutes . The transferred DNA can then be integrated into the recipient genome via homologous recombination .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_6162-6960	A cell culture that contains in its population cells with non-integrated F - plasmids usually also contains a few cells that have accidentally integrated their plasmids . It is these cells that are responsible for the low - frequency chromosomal gene transfers that occur in such cultures . Some strains of bacteria with an integrated F - plasmid can be isolated and grown in pure culture . Because such strains transfer chromosomal genes very efficiently they are called Hfr ( high frequency of recombination ) . The E. coli genome was originally mapped by interrupted mating experiments in which various Hfr cells in the process of conjugation were sheared from recipients after less than 100 minutes ( initially using a Waring blender ) . The genes that were transferred were then investigated .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_6961-7384	Since integration of the F - plasmid into the E. coli chromosome is a rare spontaneous occurrence , and since the numerous genes promoting DNA transfer are in the plasmid genome rather than in the bacterial genome , it has been argued that conjugative bacterial gene transfer , as it occurs in the E. coli Hfr system , is not an evolutionary adaptation of the bacterial host , nor is it likely ancestral to eukaryotic sex .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_7428-8410	Conjugation in Mycobacteria smegmatis , like conjugation in E. coli , requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain , is DNase resistant , and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination . However , unlike E. coli Hfr conjugation , mycobacterial conjugation is chromosome rather than plasmid based . Furthermore , in contrast to E. coli Hfr conjugation , in M. smegmatis all regions of the chromosome are transferred with comparable efficiencies . The lengths of the donor segments vary widely , but have an average length of 44.2 kb . Since a mean of 13 tracts are transferred , the average total of transferred DNA per genome is 575kb . This process is referred to as `` Distributive conjugal transfer . '' Gray et al. found substantial blending of the parental genomes as a result of conjugation and regarded this blending as reminiscent of that seen in the meiotic products of sexual reproduction .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_8509-9162	Bacteria related to the nitrogen fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case of inter-kingdom conjugation . For example , the tumor - inducing ( Ti ) plasmid of Agrobacterium and the root - tumor inducing ( Ri ) plasmid of A. rhizogenes contain genes that are capable of transferring to plant cells . The expression of these genes effectively transforms the plant cells into opine - producing factories . Opines are used by the bacteria as sources of nitrogen and energy . Infected cells form crown gall or root tumors . The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria , which are in turn endosymbionts ( or parasites ) of the infected plant .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_9163-9469	The Ti and Ri plasmids can also be transferred between bacteria using a system ( the tra , or transfer , operon ) that is different and independent of the system used for inter-kingdom transfer ( the vir , or virulence , operon ) . Such transfers create virulent strains from previously avirulent strains .	Bacterial conjugation
813681588_9512-10360	Conjugation is a convenient means for transferring genetic material to a variety of targets . In laboratories , successful transfers have been reported from bacteria to yeast , plants , mammalian cells , diatoms and isolated mammalian mitochondria . Conjugation has advantages over other forms of genetic transfer including minimal disruption of the target 's cellular envelope and the ability to transfer relatively large amounts of genetic material ( see the above discussion of E. coli chromosome transfer ) . In plant engineering , Agrobacterium - like conjugation complements other standard vehicles such as tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) . While TMV is capable of infecting many plant families these are primarily herbaceous dicots . Agrobacterium - like conjugation is also primarily used for dicots , but monocot recipients are not uncommon .	Bacterial conjugation

837850285_547-1162	The climate of Delhi is an overlap between monsoon - influenced humid subtropical ( Köppen climate classification Cwa ) and semi-arid ( Köppen climate classification BSh ) , with high variation between summer and winter temperatures and precipitation . Delhi 's version of a humid subtropical climate is markedly different from many other humid subtropical cities such as Sao Paulo , New Orleans and Brisbane in that the city features dust storms ( something more commonly seen in a desert climate ) , has relatively dry short winters and has a prolonged spell of very hot weather , due to its semi-arid climate .	Climate of Delhi
837850285_1163-1879	Summer is the best time to visit Delhi start in early April and peak in May , with average temperatures near 32 ° C although occasional heat waves can result in highs close to 45 ° C ( 114 ° F ) on some days and therefore higher apparent temperature . The monsoon starts in late June and lasts until mid-September , with about 797.3 mm ( 31.5 inches ) of rain . The average temperatures are around 29 ° C ( 85 ° F ) , although they can vary from around 25 ° C ( 78 ° F ) on rainy days to 32 ° C ( 99 ° F ) during dry spells . The monsoons recede in late September , and the post-monsoon season continues till late October , with average temperatures sliding from 29 ° C ( 85 ° F ) to 21 ° C ( 71 ° F ) .	Climate of Delhi
837850285_1880-2418	Winter starts in late November or early december and peaks in January , with average temperatures around 12 -- 13 ° C ( 54 -- 55 ° F ). Although winters are generally mild , Delhi 's proximity to the Himalayas results in cold waves leading to lower apparent temperature due to wind chill . Delhi is notorious for its heavy fogs during the winter season . In December , reduced visibility leads to disruption of road , air and rail traffic . They end in early February , and are followed by a short spring until the onset of the summer .	Climate of Delhi

837850285_3271-3861	Delhi lies in the landlocked Northern Plains of the Indian Subcontinent . Its climate is greatly influenced by its proximity to the Himalayas and the Thar Desert , causing it to experience both weather extremes . Delhi has 5 distinct seasons , viz . Summer , Rainy , Autumn , Winter and Spring . Broadly speaking , Delhi has long and scorching summers - sub-divided into summer and monsoon seasons , short and cold winters , and two bouts of pleasant transition seasons . Two most important wind patterns influencing Delhi 's climate are the Western Disturbance and the South - West Winds .	Climate of Delhi
837850285_3878-5825	Summer begins in early April and continues till the end of June , with the heat peaking in May . It is characterized by extreme heat , low humidity , very hot winds and thunderstorms . Delhi 's proximity to the Thar Desert results in hot , dry continental winds , called loo , at times blowing all across from the West Asian mainland , making the days feel hotter . These winds , blowing over from vast land stretches , are very hot and dry . Since the Western Disturbance depression moves eastward ( and is the reason for cyclonic occurrences in Eastern Coastal areas ) by this time of the year , there is no moisture - laden wind to increase humidity . The air therefore remains dry or very dry during day . For most of its summer season , Delhi has a semi-arid climate . Coming from Spring , the city witnesses a spurt in day temperature around early April , whereas nights still remain pleasant . By the latter part of April or during early May , maximum temperatures exceed 40 ° C while the ambience remains very dry . Night temperatures cross the 20 ° C mark towards the latter part of April . May is Delhi 's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45 ° C or higher . This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms . Dust storms are another feature of Delhi 's summer , and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds , particularly under cumulonimbus formation . These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert . They make the surroundings appear pale yellow , bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms . Post mid-June , temperatures start falling slowly , while humidity shows a gradual rise . A visual characteristic of summer in Delhi is the summer bloom , particularly the blooming Bougainvillea , Amaltas , Gulmohar , Shireesh and Jacaranda trees , which look spectacular when fully flowering during peak summer in May .	Climate of Delhi
837850285_5843-6818	Monsoon winds arrive in Delhi by either the end of June or the first week of July . The arrival of moisture laden South - Western winds , traveling from the Arabian Sea marks the onset of Rainy season in Delhi . This season is marked by high levels of humidity and high heat . Day temperatures drop below 40 ° C as humidity suddenly soars . July is marked by high heat and relatively less precipitation ( as compared to August ) . This transition from scorching to sweltering heat between June and July makes the latter feel very uncomfortable . August is Delhi 's wettest month . The heat is considerably reduced and it is relatively cooler for most part of the month . There is dense cloud formation in the sky and at least a week of distinct , very heavy rainfall . By September , the amount and frequency of precipitation drops , though humidity remains high . Towards the end of September , moisture content in the air begins to fall and monsoon ends by early October .	Climate of Delhi
837850285_6835-7541	The end of monsoon marks the arrival of a transition season . Autumn arrives by early or mid October , and is marked by very dry ambiance , warm days and pleasant nights . Maximum temperatures drop below 30 ° C by late October and there is a gradual fall in average temperature . Minimum temperature drops below 20 ° C. During Autumn , the wind direction begins changing from South - Westerly to North - Westerly . Around late autumn / early winter , the variation between morning and afternoon temperatures in a day becomes considerable , and can often be more than 20 ° C , with minimum dropping to under 10 ° C and maximum still hovering slightly under 30 ° C . This season ends by early December .	Climate of Delhi
837850285_7558-9839	Winter arrives in Delhi by late November or early December . Minimum temperatures gradually enter single digits by this time of the year , while days are pleasant . Though usually not cold initially , December suddenly becomes cold in the latter half , as chilly north - western winds from the Himalayas begin sweeping the Northern Plains . These cold waves are caused by a depression created by Western Disturbance , which bring cloud cover and occasional winter rains to the Plains , and add to snowfall in the North - Western Indian Subcontinent . By early January , when winter peaks in Delhi , the minimum temperatures plunge to the vicinity of 0 ° C , though very rarely entering the negative scale . Maximum temperatures , too may drop down into single digits and always stay under 20 ° C. When the minimum temperature ventures very close to the 0 ° C mark , Delhi witnesses frost . Snow is a practical impossibility for Delhi ( and the rest of Northern Plains ) due to very dry nature of its winter - the coldest conditions happen under clear skies when icy winds rush in from the Himalayas , and a cloud cover ( which is necessary for causing snowfall ) rather warms the city by trapping heat , thereby junking any possibility of snow . Delhi 's winter is marked by very dense fog , which dramatically reduces visibility and makes days colder by cutting off sunlight . In the opposite scenario , cold north - westerly winds from the upper reaches of Himalayas blowing across the city makes the days feel colder , despite any sunshine and the nights further cold . Post mid-January , average temperatures begin to rise very gradually , though the rise is almost contained by the cold north - western winds which result due to very heavy snowfall that occurs in the Himalayas during this part of the month . It may rain towards the end of January and the precipitation is usually accompanied by hail , resulting in slight increase in minimum temperatures due to cloud cover . Maximum temperatures again cross 20 ° C and days become pleasant . By mid-February or somewhat beyond , minimum temperature crosses the 10 ° C mark and days start getting warmer gradually , marking the end of winter . Delhi can sometimes have prolonged season of chill , extending into March .	Climate of Delhi
837850285_9856-10793	Around the middle of February , Delhi 's climate sees another transition , this time from Winter to Summer . The transition weather is known as Spring and is characterized by warm days , cool nights , dry ambiance and lively natural surroundings . The weather is pleasant and there is warm , brilliant sunshine during the day . Spring rains are a characteristic of this season . These rains may be accompanied by hail and can be heavy . Average temperatures show a slow , gradual rise as the wind direction shift from North - West to South - West , thereby getting warmer . Around late spring / early summer , the variation between morning and afternoon temperatures in a day becomes considerable , and can often be more than 20 ° C , with maximum rising to mid 30 's ° C and minimum in the mid 10 's ° C. Spring ends by the latter half of March and the day temperatures exceed 30 ° C by then , marking the onset of the next summer .	Climate of Delhi
837850285_10816-11149	Temperature records for Delhi exist for a period of a little over 100 years .

832994691_156-292	The timeline of children 's rights in the United Kingdom includes a variety of events that are both political and grassroots in nature .	Timeline of young people's rights in the United Kingdom
832994691_293-982	The UK government maintains a position that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ( UNCRC ) is not legally enforceable and is hence ' aspirational ' only , although a 2003 ECHR ruling states that , `` The human rights of children and the standards to which all governments must aspire in realising these rights for all children are set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child . '' Eighteen years after ratification , the four Children 's Commissioners in the UK ( including those for the three devolved administrations ) have united in calling for adoption of the Convention into domestic legislation , making children 's rights recognised and legally binding .	Timeline of young people's rights in the United Kingdom
832994691_983-1723	Opponents of children 's rights often raise the objection that rights must entail responsibilities . The children 's rights movement asserts rather that children have rights which adults , states and the government have a responsibility to uphold . Overall , a 2008 report stated that there had been no improvement in children 's rights in the UK since 2002 . Warning that there is a `` widely held fear of children and young people '' in the UK , the report says : `` The incessant portrayal of children as thugs and yobs '' not only reinforces the fears of the public but also influences policy and legislation . '' The report does not address the question of the degree to which the fear of uncontrolled children in the UK is justified .	Timeline of young people's rights in the United Kingdom
832994691_1724-2324	The UNCRC defines children , for the purposes of the Convention , as persons under the age 18 , unless domestic legislation provides otherwise . In that spirit , this timeline includes as children all those below the UK age of majority , which was 21 until 1970 when it was reduced to 18 . Although the Crown Dependencies of the Isle of Man , Guernsey and Jersey are not constitutionally part of the UK , the British government is responsible for their external affairs and therefore for their international treaty obligations , so this timeline includes references to matters in those dependencies .

832994691_2474-8442	Timeline of pre-19th century events related to Children 's Rights in the UK in chronological order Date Parties Event Image Pre-16th century The care of orphans was particularly commended to bishops and monasteries during the Middle Ages . Many orphanages practised a form of `` binding - out '' in which children , as soon as they were old enough , were given as apprentices to households to ensure their support and their learning an occupation . Common law maintaining the King 's peace was administered by the Court of Common Pleas ( England ) dealing with civil cases between parties by ordering the fine of debts and seizure of the goods of outlaws . Following the Peasants ' Revolt , British constables were authorised under a 1383 statute to collar vagabonds and force them to show their means of support ; if they could not , the penalty was gaol . Under a 1494 statute , vagabonds could be sentenced to the stocks for three days and nights ; in 1530 , whipping was added . The assumption was that vagabonds were unlicensed beggars . January 1561 Scotland The national Church of Scotland set out a programme for spiritual reform , setting the principle of a school teacher for every parish church and free education . This was provided for by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland , passed in 1633 , which introduced a tax to pay for this programme . 1367 -- 1607 Ireland Suppression of the Brehon Laws which enumerated the rights and responsibilities of fostered children , their birth - parents and foster - parents . The Brehon Law concept of family was eroded and the Gaelic tradition of fosterage lost . It was ultimately replaced by the State controlled Poor Law system . 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law The Poor Law was the social security system operating in England and Wales from the 16th century until the establishment of the Welfare State in the 20th century . The Impotent poor was a classification of poverty used to refer to those poor considered deserving of poor relief ; a vagrant was a person who could work , but preferred not to . The law did not distinguish between the impotent poor and the criminal , so both received the same punishments . The law provided for `` the putting out of children to be apprentices '' . 17th century Where an unmarried mother concealed the death of her baby , she was presumed guilty of infanticide unless she could prove that the baby was born dead . This requirement that the defendant prove her innocence was a reversal of the normal practice of requiring the prosecution to prove the defendant 's guilt . Women were acquitted of this charge if they could demonstrate that they had prepared for the birth of the baby , for example by acquiring bedding . In 1678 children aged 10 were deemed able to engage in consensual sex . 1732 -- 1744 Bastardy In 1732 , a woman pregnant with a `` bastard '' was required to declare the fact and to name the father . In 1733 , the putative father became responsible for maintaining his illegitimate child ; failing to do so could result in gaol . The parish would then support the mother and child , until the father agreed to do so , whereupon he would reimburse the parish -- although this rarely happened . In 1744 , a bastard took the ' settlement ' of its mother ( under the Poor Law , a person 's place of origin or later established residence , being the parish responsible for the person if destitute ) regardless of where the child was actually born . Previously , a bastard took settlement from its place of birth . The mother was to be publicly whipped . 1739 The Foundling Hospital Established in London by the philanthropic sea captain Thomas Coram as a home for the `` education and maintenance of exposed and deserted young children . '' Children were seldom taken after they were twelve months old . On reception they were sent to wet nurses in the countryside , where they stayed until they were about four or five years old . At sixteen girls were generally apprenticed as servants for four years ; at fourteen , boys became apprentices in varying occupations for seven years . 1779 The Penitentiary Act Drafted by Prison reformer John Howard , the Act introduced state prisons as an alternative to the death penalty or transportation . The prison population had risen after the US Declaration of Independence , because the American Colonies had been used as the destination for transported criminals . Howard 's 1777 report had identified appalling conditions in most of the prisons he inspected . The Howard League for Penal Reform emerged as a result , publishing in 2006 the findings of an independent inquiry by Lord Carlile of Berriew QC into physical restraint , solitary confinement and forcible strip searching of children in prisons , secure training centres and local authority secure children 's homes . 1795 Speenhamland system An amendment to the Poor Law , named after a meeting at the Pelican Inn in Speenhamland , Berkshire , where the local magistrates or squirearchy devised the system as a means to alleviate hardship caused by a spike in grain prices . Families were paid extra to top up wages to a set level , which varied according to the number of children and the price of bread . For example , if bread was 1s 2d a loaf , the wages of a family with two children was topped up to 8s 6d . If bread rose to 1s 8d the wages were topped up to 11s 0d . The system aggravated the underlying causes of poverty , allowing employers ( often farmers ) to pay below subsistence wages , because the parish made up the difference to keep their workers alive . Low incomes remained unchanged and the poor rate contributors subsidised the farmers , so that landowners sought other means of dealing with the poor e.g. the workhouse . The Poor Law Commissioners ' Report of 1834 called the Speenhamland System a `` universal system of pauperism . '' 1796 Thomas Spence Publication of The Rights of Infants by the revolutionary philosopher. ( 11 )	Timeline of young people's rights in the United Kingdom
832994691_8465-16794	Timeline of 19th century events related to Children 's Rights in the UK in chronological order Date Parties Event Image 1802 UK Parliament The Factory Acts were a series of Acts of Parliament passed to limit the number of hours worked by women and children , first in the textile industry , then later in all industries . The Factories Act 1802 , sometimes called the `` Health and Morals of Apprentices Act , '' 1806 Philanthropic Society The Society was incorporated by Act of Parliament , sanctioning its work with juvenile delinquents and began by opening homes where children were trained in cottage industries working under the instruction of skilled tradesmen . Remaining central in development of measures dealing with young offenders the Society is now the charity , Catch 22 , formerly Rainer . 1818 Ragged schools A cobbler , John Pounds , began to use his shop in Portsmouth as a base for educational activity for local poor children neglected by other institutions . Part of his concern was also to educate his disabled nephew . The Ragged School movement subsequently found powerful support in active philanthropists when public attention was aroused to the prevalence of juvenile delinquency by Thomas Guthrie in 1840 . An estimated 300,000 children passed through the London Ragged Schools alone between the early 1840s and 1881 1818 Elizabeth Fry After visiting Newgate Prison , Fry became particularly concerned at the conditions in which women prisoners and their children were held . Fry later presented evidence to the House of Commons in 1818 , which led to the interior of Newgate being rebuilt with individual cells . 1834 Workhouse The workhouse system was set up in England and Wales under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 , although many individual houses existed before this legislation . Inmates entered and left as they liked and would receive free food and accommodation . However , workhouse life was made as harsh and degrading as possible so that only the truly destitute would apply . Accounts of the terrible conditions in some workhouses include references to women who would not speak and children who refused to play . 1838 Charles Dickens Oliver Twist , Dickens ' second novel , is the first in the English language to centre upon a child protagonist throughout . The book calls attention to various contemporary social evils , including the Poor Law , which required that poor people work in workhouses , child labour and the recruitment of children as criminals . A later character , Jo in Bleak House , is portrayed as a street child , relentlessly pursued by a police inspector . 1839 Custody of Infants Act Custody of children under 7 years old was assigned to mothers 1840 Mettray Penal Colony In Mettray , north of the city of Tours , France a private reformatory , without walls , was opened by penal reformer Frédéric - Auguste Demetz in 1840 for the rehabilitation of young males aged between 6 and 21 . At that time children and teenagers were routinely imprisoned with adults . Boys who were mostly deprived , disadvantaged or adandoned children , many of whom had committed only Summary offences or petty crime , were housed . Their heads were shaved , they wore uniforms , and up to age 12 spent most of the day studying arithmetic , writing and reading . Older boys had one hour of classes , with the rest of the day spent working . Reformatory Schools were modelled on Mettray , and the Borstal system , established in 1905 , separated adolescents from adult prisoners . In the twentieth century Mettray became the focus for Michel Foucault because of its various systems and expressions of power and led Foucault to suggest that Mettray began the descent into modern penal theories and their inherent power structures . 1847 Juvenile Offenders Act The Act allowed children under the age of fourteen to be tried summarily before two magistrates , speeding up the process of trial for children , and removing it from the publicity of the higher courts . The age limit was raised to sixteen in 1850 . 1850 Irish Workhouse Returns , 8 June 1850 . The number of children aged 15 years and younger in Irish Workhouses reaches its historic high , at 115,639 . 1854 Reformatory Schools Mary Carpenter 's research and lobbying contributed to the Youthful Offenders Act 1854 and the Reformatory Schools ( Scotland ) Act 1854 . These enabled voluntary schools to be certified as efficient by the Inspector of Prisons , and allowed courts to send them convicted juvenile offenders under 16 for a period of 2 to 5 years , instead of prison . Parents were required to contribute to the cost . Carpenter 's 1851 publication Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes and for Juvenile Offenders was the first to coin the term ' Dangerous Classes ' with respect to the lower classes , and the perceived propensity to criminality , of poor people . 1857 Industrial Schools The Industrial Schools Act 1857 allowed magistrates to send disorderly children to a residential industrial school , resolving the problems of juvenile delinquency by removing poor and neglected children from their home environment into a boarding school . An 1876 Act led to non-residential day schools of a similar kind . In 1986 Professor Sir Leon Radzinowitz noted the practice of Economic conscription , where , ' there was a network of 208 schools : 43 reformatories , 132 industrial schools , 21 day industrial schools and 12 truant schools ' by the eve of the First World War , alongside a negligible education system for the poor . 1870 UK Government Prior to the Elementary Education Act 1870 act , very few schools existed , other than those run by the Church . The National Education League was established to promote elementary education for all children , free from religious control . The Act first introduced and enforced compulsory school attendance between the ages of 5 and 12 , with school boards set up to ensure that children attended school ; although exemptions were made for illness and travelling distance . The London School Board was highly influential and launched a number of political careers . The Church / State ethical divide in schooling , persists into the present day . 1870 Thomas John Barnardo The first of 112 Barnardo 's Homes was founded , with destitution as the criterion for qualification . The project was supported by the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury and the first Earl Cairns . The system of operation was broadly as follows : infants and younger girls and boys are chiefly `` boarded out '' in rural districts ; girls above 14 years of age are sent to ' industrial training homes ' to be taught useful domestic occupations ; boys above 17 years old are first tested in labour homes and then placed in employment at home , sent to sea or emigrated ; boys between 13 -- 17 years old were trained for trades for which they may be mentally or physically fitted . 1880 UK Government Following campaigning by the National Education League the Elementary Education Act 1880 made schooling compulsory until the age of ten and also established attendance officers to enforce attendance , so that parents who objected to compulsory education , arguing they needed children to earn a wage , could be fined for keeping their children out of school . School leaving age was raised with successive Acts from ten to age fourteen in 1918 . 1885 UK Government Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 raises age of consent from 13 to 16 , introduced measures intended to protect girls from sexual exploitation and widens the criminalisation of male homosexual behaviour . 1891 UK Government The practice of ' spiriting ' i.e. kidnapping children for work in the Americas , had been sanctioned by the Privy Council since 1620 , but the Custody of Children Act ( the ' Barnardo 's Act ) legalised the work of private emigration societies for removing poor children from workhouses , industrial schools , reformatories and private care facilities , to British colonies . 1899 UK Government The Elementary Education ( Defective and Epileptic Children ) Act allowed school authorities to make arrangements for ascertaining which children , by reason of mental or physical defect , were incapable of receiving proper benefit from instruction in the ordinary schools .

832994691_47865-56273	Timeline of 21st century events related to Children 's Rights in the UK in chronological order Date Parties Event Image 2001 Wales Children 's Commissioner for Wales was appointed . 2001 Sarah 's Law Following the abduction and murder of eight - year - old Sarah Payne , the News of the World newspaper spearheaded a controversial campaign for the government to allow controlled access to the Sex Offenders Register , so that parents with young children could know if a child sex - offender was living in their area . The campaign derived from the USA 's so - called Megan 's Law , operating in honour of murder victim Megan Kanka and allowing publication of a sex offender 's photograph and address . 2002 UK Government The Care Standards Act reformed the law relating to the inspection and regulation of various care institutions including children 's homes , and created the new post of Director of Children 's Rights with the power to investigate individual cases . October 2002 The UK committee responsible for monitoring the implementation of the UNCRC in the UK issued its second concluding observations on the UK 's progress . 2003 Northern Ireland The Commissioner for Children and Young People for Northern Ireland was appointed . 2003 UK Government The Sexual Offences Act 2003 lowered the age of consent for certain sexual activities from 18 to 16 in England and Wales . Section 45 defines a `` child '' for the purposes of the Protection of Children Act 1978 as a person under 18 years , rather than under 16 years , of age . Despite a previous `` deep lack of understanding '' of incidents of abuse in children 's homes run by Islington , Margaret Hodge is appointed Children 's Minister in June 2003 . 29 January 2003 Victoria Climbie The Laming report on the murder of Victoria Climbie recommended the creation of the post of Children 's Commissioner and generated legislation known as Every Child Matters . A revised Children Act based on Every Child Matters was enacted in 2004 . December 2003 Sir Michael Bichard After the murder of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells , the Bichard report severely criticised the Chief Constable of Humberside Police for ordering the destruction of criminal records of child abusers as required under the Protection of Children Act 1999 . A revised registration scheme for people working with children and vulnerable adults was recommended . The report also revealed that investigation into the murders was severely compromised by involvement of some of the police officers in child pornography , or were Operation Ore suspects . Zahid Mubarek Inquiry After a long legal battle by the family , the Law Lords ordered Home Secretary David Blunkett to hold an Inquiry into Zahid 's murder . Sentenced to 3 months imprisonment in Feltham Young Offenders ' Institution for stealing razors and interfering with a motor vehicle , the 19 - year - old was murdered by his cell - mate on the eve of returning home in 2000 . The report 's findings are a ' devastating indictment ' of the prison system , to which teenagers are routinely consigned . Scotland The Scotland 's Commissioner for Children and Young People was appointed , with Children 's Hearings and the Scottish Children 's Reporter Administration as significant components of children 's rights in Scotland . 2005 England The Children 's Commissioner for England was appointed . September 2005 United Nations General Assembly A Special Summit on the Millennium Development Goals reviewed progress since 2000 on the Goals , which included halving the proportion of people living in poverty by 2015 . November 2005 Ampleforth College A monk admitted to 20 incidents of child abuse at a leading Catholic boarding school . At least six paedophiles were active for decades following a decision by former Abbot Basil Hume not to call in police during his tenure , which commenced in 1963 . March 2006 British Army An independent review commissioned by the Minister for Armed Forces into circumstances surrounding the deaths of four soldiers recruited under the age of 18 at Princess Royal Barracks , Deepcut between 1995 and 2002 , concludes that the deaths were self - inflicted , despite a catalogue of allegations of misconduct at the relevant times . The call for a public enquiry is rejected . 2006 End Child Poverty Following the Make Poverty History march and Live 8 events , NGOs launch a coalition to secure the Government 's 1999 pledge to halve the numbers of children living below the poverty line by 2010 and eliminate child poverty by 2020 . February 2006 Howard League for Penal Reform Publication of Lord Carlile 's inquiry into the treatment of children in penal custody . The 47 recommendations include : severely restricting physical intervention ; stopping the Strip searching of children ; and an end to prison segregation . 2007 Jersey Social Worker Simon Bellwood was dismissed after making a complaint about a `` Dickensian '' system in a secure unit where children as young as 11 were routinely locked up for 24 hours or more , in solitary confinement . Police subsequently commenced investigations at the site of former children 's home Haut de la Garenne . July 2007 UK Government The third report on progress is issued to the UN Committee responsible for monitoring implementation of the UNCRC . 2007 Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 The Act was extended to apply to prisoners and young offenders killed or injured whilst in custody , with effect from April 2008 . From monitoring and analysis of deaths in custody , NGO INQUEST propose an independent , overarching standing commission on custodial deaths , with statutory powers to address the breadth of social and political issues that arise when these deaths occur . November 2007 Scottish Government Following publication of the Shaw report `` Historical Abuse Systemic Review : Residential Schools and Children 's Homes in Scotland 1950 to 1995 '' , the Scottish Government proposed a truth and reconciliation forum for victims of historic abuse . The discussion paper named `` Acknowledgement and Accountability '' will be published 2008 / 9 . 9 June 2008 United Kingdom The Children 's Commissioner for Wales , Children 's Commissioner for England , Scotland 's Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Commissioner for Children and Young People , Northern Ireland jointly report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child , in preparation for the 30th Anniversary of the International Year of the Child . The remit of individual UK Commissioners differ in the devolved administrations , however the first report by federal Commissioners is unanimous in calling for incorporation of UNCRC into domestic legislation and a ban on police indefinitely keeping children 's DNA on record . Amongst 100 recommendations are : increasing the age of criminal responsibility ; a reduction in the number of children in custody ; and a public inquiry into the deaths of 30 children in custody over the past 10 years . UK 's main NGO 's including UNICEF and CRAE also attended the Pre Sessional Working Group with the UN Committee . 12 Children and Young People represented England as well . November 2008 Death of Baby P After details of the tragic life and death of the 17 - month - old at the hands of his parent and carers , whilst on the ' At Risk ' register of Haringey Social Services were revealed , Ofsted confirmed that between April 2007 and August 2008 , 282 children died of neglect , abuse or in the care system . Of that total , 72 died in accidents , stabbings or shootings while in foster or residential care , while the remaining 210 died of abuse or neglect at the hands of their families . This means that 12 children are killed by abuse each month . 1 May 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act Part 1 , Chapter 2 gives a child the right to prevent their biometric information ( e.g. fingerprints ) from being collected by an educational establishment and requires the processing of biometric information to be discontinued should the child object at any time . The right of a child to refuse the collection of their biometric information stands regardless of whether parental consent is offered or not . It also requires one parent to provide consent for the processing of biometric data and if any parent is to object to such collection of data the data processing must be discontinued .

838404409_20947-22222	Chinese history is often explained in terms of several strategic areas , defined by particular topographic limits . Starting from the Chinese central plain , the former heart of the Han populations , the Han people expanded militarily and then demographically toward the Loess Plateau , the Sichuan Basin , and the Southern Hills ( as defined by the map on the left ) , not without resistance from local populations . Pushed by its comparatively higher demographic growth , the Han continued their expansion by military and demographic waves . The far - south of present - day China , the northern parts of today 's Vietnam , and the Tarim Basin were first reached and durably subdued by the Han dynasty 's armies . The Northern steppes were always the source of invasions into China , which culminated in the 13th century by Mongolian conquest of the whole China and creation of Mongolian Yuan dynasty . Manchuria , much of today 's Northeast China , and Korean Peninsula were usually not under Chinese control , with the exception of some limited periods of occupation . Manchuria became strongly integrated into the Chinese empire during the late Qing dynasty , while the west side of the Changbai Mountains , formerly the home of Korean tribes , thus also entered China .

838404409_24193-25857	China 's borders have more than 20,000 km ( 12,000 mi ) of land frontier shared with nearly all the nations of mainland East Asia , and have been disputed at a number of points . In the western sector , China claimed portions of the 41,000 km ( 16,000 sq mi ) Pamir Mountains area , a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier - filled valleys where the borders of Afghanistan , Pakistan , the former Soviet Union , and China meet in Central Asia . North and east of this region , some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987 . The 6,542 kilometres ( 4,065 mi ) frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction . In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own . In the northeast , border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang along segments of the Argun River , Amur River , and Ussuri River . Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area . In a September 1986 speech in Vladivostok , the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered the Chinese a more conciliatory position on Sino - Soviet border issues . In 1987 the two sides resumed border talks that had been broken off after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ( see Sino - Soviet relations ) . Although the border issue remained unresolved as of late 1987 , China and the Soviet Union agreed to consider the northeastern sector first . In October 2004 , China signed an agreement with Russia on the delimitation of their entire 4,300 km ( 2,700 mi ) - long border , which had long been in dispute .	Geography of China

The area was demarcated by the British McMahon Line , drawn along the Himalayas in 1914 as the Sino - Indian border ; India accepts and China rejects this boundary . In June 1980 China made its first move in twenty years to settle the border disputes with India , proposing that India cede the Aksai Chin area in Jammu and Kashmir to China in return for China 's recognition of the McMahon Line ; India did not accept the offer , however , preferring a sector - by - sector approach to the problem . In July 1986 China and India held their seventh round of border talks , but they made little headway toward resolving the dispute . Each side , but primarily India , continued to make allegations of incursions into its territory by the other . Most of the mountainous and militarized boundary with India is still in dispute , but Beijing and New Delhi have committed to begin resolution with discussions on the least disputed middle sector .

837105854_156-830	A modem ( modulator -- demodulator ) is a network hardware device that modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information . The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data . Modems can be used with any means of transmitting analog signals , from light - emitting diodes to radio . A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data .	Modem
837105854_831-1692	Modems are generally classified by the maximum amount of data they can send in a given unit of time , usually expressed in bits per second ( symbol bit ( s ) , sometimes abbreviated `` bps '' ) , or bytes per second ( symbol B ( s ) ) . Modems can also be classified by their symbol rate , measured in baud . The baud unit denotes symbols per second , or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal . For example , the ITU V. 21 standard used audio frequency - shift keying with two possible frequencies , corresponding to two distinct symbols ( or one bit per symbol ) , to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baud . By contrast , the original ITU V. 22 standard , which could transmit and receive four distinct symbols ( two bits per symbol ) , transmitted 1,200 bits by sending 600 symbols per second ( 600 baud ) using phase - shift keying .

However , the modem function was incidental to the multiplexing function , so they are not commonly included in the history of modems . Modems grew out of the need to connect teleprinters over ordinary phone lines instead of the more expensive leased lines which had previously been used for current loop -- based teleprinters and automated telegraphs .

SAGE modems were described by AT&T 's Bell Labs as conforming to their newly published Bell 101 dataset standard . While they ran on dedicated telephone lines , the devices at each end were no different from commercial acoustically coupled Bell 101 , 110 baud modems .	Modem
837105854_4011-4364	The 201A and 201B Data - Phones were synchronous modems using two - bit - per - baud phase - shift keying ( PSK ) .

837105854_4365-4943	The famous Bell 103A dataset standard was also introduced by AT&T in 1962 . It provided full - duplex service at 300 bit / s over normal phone lines .

837105854_5273-6145	For many years , the Bell System ( AT&T ) maintained a monopoly on the use of its phone lines and what devices could be connected to them . However , the FCC 's seminal Carterfone Decision of 1968 , the FCC concluded that electronic devices could be connected to the telephone system as long as they used an acoustic coupler . Since most handsets were supplied by Western Electric and thus of a standard design , acoustic couplers were relatively easy to build . Acoustically coupled Bell 103A - compatible 300 bit / s modems were common during the 1970s . Well - known models included the Novation CAT and the Anderson - Jacobson , the latter spun off from an in - house project at Stanford Research Institute ( now SRI International ) . An even lower - cost option was the Pennywhistle modem , designed to be built using parts from electronics scrap and surplus stores .	Modem
837105854_6146-6957	In December 1972 , Vadic introduced the VA3400 , notable for full - duplex operation at 1,200 bit / s over the phone network . Like the 103A , it used different frequency bands for transmit and receive . In November 1976 , AT&T introduced the 212A modem to compete with Vadic . It was similar in design , but used the lower frequency set for transmission . One could also use the 212A with a 103A modem at 300 bit / s . According to Vadic , the change in frequency assignments made the 212 intentionally incompatible with acoustic coupling , thereby locking out many potential modem manufacturers . In 1977 , Vadic responded with the VA3467 triple modem , an answer - only modem sold to computer center operators that supported Vadic 's 1,200 - bit / s mode , AT&T 's 212A mode , and 103A operation .

837105854_7228-7714	The Hush - a-Phone decision applied only to mechanical connections , but the Carterfone decision of 1968 , led to the FCC introducing a rule setting stringent AT&T - designed tests for electronically coupling a device to the phone lines . This opened the door to direct - connect modems that plugged directly into the phone line rather than via a handset . However , the cost of passing the tests was considerable , and acoustically coupled modems remained common into the early 1980s .	Modem
837105854_7715-8548	The rapidly falling prices of electronics in the late 1970s led to an increasing number of direct - connect models around 1980 . In spite of being directly connected , these modems were generally operated like their earlier acoustic versions -- dialing and other phone - control operations were completed by hand , using an attached handset . A small number of modems added the ability to automatically answer incoming calls , or automatically place an outgoing call to a single number , but even these limited features were relatively rare or limited to special models in a lineup . When more flexible solutions were needed , third party `` dialers '' were used to automate calling , normally using a separate serial port to communicate with the dialler , which would then control the modem through a private electrical connection .

837105854_8549-9214	The introduction of microcomputer systems with internal expansion slots made the first software - controllable modems common .

837105854_9677-10412	The next major advance in modems was the Hayes Smartmodem , introduced in 1981 . The Smartmodem was an otherwise standard 103A 300 bit / s direct - connect modem , but it was attached to a small microcontroller that watched the data stream for certain character strings representing commands . This allowed both data and commands to be sent through a single serial port . The now - standard Hayes command set included instructions for picking up and hanging up the phone , dialing numbers , and answering calls , among others . This was similar to the commands offered by the internal modems , but unlike them , the Smartmodem could be connected to any computer with an RS - 232 port , which was practically every microcomputer built .	Modem
837105854_10413-11214	The introduction of the Smartmodem made communications much simpler and more easily accessed . This provided a growing market for other vendors , who licensed the Hayes patents and competed on price or by adding features . Through the 1980s , a number of new higher - speed modems , first 1,200 and then 2,400 bit / s , greatly improved the responsiveness of the online systems , and made file transfer practical . This led to rapid growth of online services with their large file libraries , which in turn gave more reason to own a modem . The rapid update of modems led to a similar rapid increase in BBS use , which was helped by the fact that BBSs could control the modem simply by sending strings , rather than talking to a device driver that was different for every direct - connect modem . 1200	Modem

837105854_11480-12021	The 300 bit / s modems used audio frequency - shift keying to send data . In this system , the stream of 1s and 0s in computer data is translated into sounds which can be easily sent on the phone lines . In the Bell 103 system , the originating modem sends 0s by playing a 1,070 Hz tone , and 1s at 1,270 Hz , with the answering modem transmitting its 0s on 2,025 Hz and 1s on 2,225 Hz . These frequencies were chosen carefully ; they are in the range that suffers minimum distortion on the phone system and are not harmonics of each other .	Modem
837105854_12022-13129	In the 1,200 bit / s and faster systems , phase - shift keying was used . In this system the two tones for any one side of the connection are sent at similar frequencies as in the 300 bit / s systems , but slightly out of phase . Voiceband modems generally remained at 300 and 1,200 bit / s ( V. 21 and V. 22 ) into the mid-1980s . A V. 22bis 2,400 - bit / s system similar in concept to the 1,200 - bit / s Bell 212 signaling was introduced in the U.S. , and a slightly different one in Europe . The limited available frequency range meant the symbol rate of 1,200 bit / s modems was still only 600 baud ( symbols per second ) . The bit rate increases were achieved by defining four or eight distinct symbols , which allowed the encoding of two or three bits per symbol instead of only 1 . The use of smaller shifts had the drawback of making each symbol more vulnerable to interference , but improvements in phone line quality at the same time helped compensate for this . By the late 1980s , most modems could support all of these standards and 2,400 - bit / s operation was becoming common . Proprietary	Modem

837105854_13388-13835	Many other standards were also introduced for special purposes , commonly using a high - speed channel for receiving , and a lower - speed channel for sending . One typical example was used in the French Minitel system , in which the user 's terminals spent the majority of their time receiving information . The modem in the Minitel terminal thus operated at 1,200 bit / s for reception , and 75 bit / s for sending commands back to the servers .	Modem
837105854_13836-14592	Three U.S. companies became famous for high - speed versions of the same concept . Telebit introduced its Trailblazer modem in 1984 , which used a large number of 36 bit / s channels to send data one - way at rates up to 18,432 bit / s . A single additional channel in the reverse direction allowed the two modems to communicate how much data was waiting at either end of the link , and the modems could change direction on the fly . The Trailblazer modems also supported a feature that allowed them to spoof the UUCP g protocol , commonly used on Unix systems to send e-mail , and thereby speed UUCP up by a tremendous amount . Trailblazers thus became extremely common on Unix systems , and maintained their dominance in this market well into the 1990s .	Modem
837105854_14593-15268	USRobotics ( USR ) introduced a similar system , known as HST , although this supplied only 9,600 bit / s ( in early versions at least ) and provided for a larger backchannel . Rather than offer spoofing , USR instead created a large market among Fidonet users by offering its modems to BBS sysops at a much lower price , resulting in sales to end users who wanted faster file transfers . Hayes was forced to compete , and introduced its own 9,600 bit / s standard , Express 96 ( also known as Ping - Pong ) , which was generally similar to Telebit 's PEP . Hayes , however , offered neither protocol spoofing nor sysop discounts , and its high - speed modems remained rare .	Modem
837105854_15269-16168	A common feature of these high - speed modems was the concept of fallback , or speed hunting , allowing them to communicate with less - capable modems . During the call initiation , the modem would transmit a series of signals and wait for the remote modem to respond . They would start at high speeds and get progressively slower until there was a response . Thus , two USR modems would be able to connect at 9,600 bit / s , but , when a user with a 2,400 bit / s modem called in , the USR would fall back to the common 2,400 bit / s speed . This would also happen if a V. 32 modem and a HST modem were connected . Because they used a different standard at 9,600 bit / s , they would fall back to their highest commonly supported standard at 2,400 bit / s . The same applies to V. 32bis and 14,400 bit / s HST modem , which would still be able to communicate with each other at 2,400 bit / s . Echo	Modem

837105854_16558-17367	Local telephone lines use the same wires to send and receive data , which results in a small amount of the outgoing signal being reflected back . This is useful for people talking on the phone , as it provides a signal to the speaker that their voice is making it through the system . However , this reflected signal causes problems for the modem , which is unable to distinguish between a signal from the remote modem and the echo of its own signal . This was why earlier modems split the signal frequencies into `` answer '' and `` originate '' ; the modem could then ignore any signals in the frequency range it was using for transmission . Even with improvements to the phone system allowing higher speeds , this splitting of available phone signal bandwidth still imposed a half - speed limit on modems .	Modem
837105854_17368-17992	Echo cancellation eliminated this problem . During the call setup and negotiation period , both modems send a series of unique tones and then listen for them to return through the phone system . They measure the total delay time and then set up a local delay loop to the same time . Once the connection is completed , they send their signals into the phone lines as normal , but also into the delay , which is inverted . The signal returning through the echo meets the inverted version coming from the delay line , and cancels out the echo . This allowed both modems to use the full spectrum available , doubling the speed .	Modem
837105854_17993-18697	Additional improvements were introduced via the quadrature amplitude modulation ( QAM ) encoding system . Previous systems using phase shift keying ( PSK ) encoded two bits ( or sometimes three ) per symbol by slightly delaying or advancing the signal 's phase relative to a set carrier tone . QAM used a combination of phase shift and amplitude to encode four bits per symbol . Transmitting at 1,200 baud produced the 4,800 bit / s V. 27ter standard , the same working at a base rate of 2,400 baud produced the 9,600 bit / s V. 32 . The carrier frequency was 1,650 Hz in both systems . For many years , most engineers considered this rate to be the limit of data communications over telephone networks .	Modem
837105854_18698-19115	The introduction of these higher - speed systems also led to the digital fax machine during the 1980s . Digital faxes are simply an image format sent over a high - speed ( commonly 14.4 kbit / s ) modem . Software running on the host computer can convert any image into fax format , which can then be sent using the modem . Such software was at one time an add - on , but has since become largely universal . Breaking	Modem

837105854_19406-19519	The first 9,600 bit / s modem was developed in 1968 , and sold for more than $20,000 , but had high error rates .	Modem
837105854_19520-20175	In 1980 , Gottfried Ungerboeck from IBM Zurich Research Laboratory applied channel coding techniques to search for new ways to increase the speed of modems . His results were astonishing but only conveyed to a few colleagues . In 1982 , he agreed to publish what is now a landmark paper in the theory of information coding . By applying parity check coding to the bits in each symbol , and mapping the encoded bits into a two - dimensional diamond pattern , Ungerboeck showed that it was possible to increase the speed by a factor of two with the same error rate . The new technique was called mapping by set partitions , now known as trellis modulation .	Modem
837105854_20176-20573	Error correcting codes , which encode code words ( sets of bits ) in such a way that they are far from each other , so that in case of error they are still closest to the original word ( and not confused with another ) can be thought of as analogous to sphere packing or packing pennies on a surface : the further two bit sequences are from one another , the easier it is to correct minor errors .	Modem
837105854_20574-20802	Dave Forney introduced the trellis diagram in a landmark 1973 paper that popularized the Viterbi algorithm . Practically all modems operating faster than 9600 bit / s decode trellis - modulated data using the Viterbi algorithm .	Modem
837105854_20803-21492	V. 32 modems operating at 9600 bit / s were expensive and were only starting to enter the market in the early 1990s when V. 32bis was standardized . Rockwell International 's chip division developed a new driver chip set incorporating the standard and aggressively priced it . Supra , Inc. arranged a short - term exclusivity arrangement with Rockwell , and developed the SupraFAXModem 14400 based on it . Introduced in January 1992 at $399 ( or less ) , it was half the price of the slower V. 32 modems already on the market . This led to a price war , and by the end of the year V. 32 was dead , never having been really established , and V. 32bis modems were widely available for $250 .	Modem
837105854_21493-21776	V. 32bis was so successful that the older high - speed standards had little to recommend them . USR fought back with a 16,800 bit / s version of HST , while AT&T introduced a one - off 19,200 bit / s method they referred to as V. 32ter , but neither non-standard modem sold well . V.	Modem
837105854_21967-22457	Any interest in these proprietary improvements was destroyed during the lengthy introduction of the 28,800 bit / s V. 34 standard . While waiting , several companies decided to release hardware and introduced modems they referred to as V. FAST . In order to guarantee compatibility with V. 34 modems once the standard was ratified ( 1994 ) , the manufacturers were forced to use more flexible parts , generally a DSP and microcontroller , as opposed to purpose - designed ASIC modem chips .	Modem
837105854_22458-23390	The ITU standard V. 34 represents the culmination of the joint efforts . It employs the most powerful coding techniques including channel encoding and shape encoding . From the mere four bits per symbol ( 9.6 kbit / s ) , the new standards used the functional equivalent of 6 to 10 bits per symbol , plus increasing baud rates from 2,400 to 3,429 , to create 14.4 , 28.8 , and 33.6 kbit / s modems . This rate is near the theoretical Shannon limit . When calculated , the Shannon capacity of a narrowband line is bandwidth × log 2 ⁡ ( 1 + P u / P n ) ( \ displaystyle ( \ text ( bandwidth ) ) \ times \ log _ ( 2 ) ( 1 + P_ ( u ) / P_ ( n ) ) ) , with P u / P n ( \ displaystyle P_ ( u ) / P_ ( n ) ) the ( linear ) signal - to - noise ratio . Narrowband phone lines have a bandwidth of 3,000 Hz so using P u / P n = 1000 ( \ displaystyle P_ ( u ) / P_ ( n ) = 1000 ) ( SNR = 30 dB ) , the capacity is approximately 30 kbit / s .	Modem
837105854_23391-23632	Without the discovery and eventual application of trellis modulation , maximum telephone rates using voice - bandwidth channels would have been limited to 3,429 baud × 4 bit / symbol = approximately 14 kbit / s using traditional QAM . Using	Modem
837105854_23700-25625	During the late 1990s , Rockwell - Lucent and USRobotics introduced competing technologies based upon the digital transmission used in telephony networks . The standard digital transmission in modern networks is 64 kbit / s but some networks use a part of the bandwidth for remote office signaling ( e.g. to hang up the phone ) , limiting the effective rate to 56 kbit / s DS0 . This new technology was adopted into ITU standards V. 90 and is common in modern computers . The 56 kbit / s rate is only possible from the central office to the user site ( downlink ) . In the United States , government regulation limits the maximum power output , resulting in a maximum data rate of 53.3 kbit / s . The uplink ( from the user to the central office ) still uses V. 34 technology at 33.6 kbit / s . USRobotics began work on the technology first , calling theirs X2 because 56k was twice the speed of 28k modems . USRobotics held a 40 - percent share of the retail modem market , and Rockwell International held an 80 - percent share of the modem chipset market . Concerned with being shut out of the market , Rockwell began work on a rival 56k technology and joined with Lucent and Motorola on what it called K56Flex or Flex . Both technologies reached the market around February 1997 ; although problems with K56Flex modems were noted in product reviews through July , within six months they worked equally well with variations dependent on local connection characteristics . The retail price of the 56K modems was about US $200 , compared to $100 for 33K modems . Separate equipment was required by Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to support the incompatible technologies , with costs varying depending on whether their current equipment could be upgraded . About half of all ISPs offered 56K support by October 1997 . Consumer sales were relatively low , which USRobotics and Rockwell attributed to conflicting standards .	Modem
837105854_25626-26046	The International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) announced the draft of a new 56 kbit / s standard , V. 90 , in February 1998 , with strong industry support . Incompatible with either existing standard , it was an amalgam of both which was designed to allow both types of modem to be converted to it by a firmware upgrade . This V. 90 standard was approved in September 1998 , and widely adopted by ISPs and consumers .	Modem
837105854_26047-26950	Later in V. 92 , the digital PCM technique was applied to increase the upload speed to a maximum of 48 kbit / s , but at the expense of download rates . A 48 kbit / s upstream rate would reduce the downstream as low as 40 kbit / s due to echo on the telephone line . To avoid this problem , V. 92 modems offer the option to turn off the digital upstream and instead use a 33.6 kbit / s analog connection , in order to maintain a high digital downstream of 50 kbit / s or higher . V. 92 also adds two other features . The first is the ability for users who have call waiting to put their dial - up Internet connection on hold for extended periods of time while they answer a call . The second feature is the ability to quickly connect to one 's ISP . This is achieved by remembering the analog and digital characteristics of the telephone line , and using this saved information when reconnecting . Using	Modem
837105854_26994-27584	V. 42 , V. 42bis and V. 44 standards allow the modem to transmit data faster than its basic rate would imply . For instance , a 53.3 kbit / s connection with V. 44 can transmit up to 53.3 × 6 = 320 kbit / s using pure text . However , the compression ratio tends to vary due to noise on the line , or due to the transfer of already - compressed files ( ZIP files , JPEG images , MP3 audio , MPEG video ) . At some points the modem will be sending compressed files at approximately 50 kbit / s , uncompressed files at 160 kbit / s , and pure text at 320 kbit / s , or any value in between .	Modem
837105854_27585-28153	In such situations , a small amount of memory in the modem , a buffer , is used to hold the data while it is being compressed and sent across the phone line , but in order to prevent overflow of the buffer , it sometimes becomes necessary to tell the computer to pause the datastream . This is accomplished through hardware flow control using extra lines on the modem -- computer connection . The computer is then set to supply the modem at some higher rate , such as 320 kbit / s , and the modem will tell the computer when to start or stop sending data . Compression	Modem

837105854_28411-29162	As telephone - based 56k modems began losing popularity , some Internet service providers such as Netzero / Juno , Netscape , and others started using pre-compression to increase the throughput and maintain their customer base . The server - side compression operates much more efficiently than the on - the - fly compression done by modems because these compression techniques are application - specific ( JPEG , text , EXE , etc . ) . The website text , images , and Flash executables are compacted to approximately 4 % , 12 % , and 30 % , respectively . The drawback of this approach is a loss in quality , which causes image content to become pixelated and smeared . ISPs employing this approach often advertise it as `` accelerated dial - up '' .

837105854_29690-30395	A Winmodem or softmodem is a stripped - down modem that replaces tasks traditionally handled in hardware with software . In this case the modem is a simple interface designed to act as a digital - to - analog and an analog - to - digital converter . Softmodems are cheaper than traditional modems because they have fewer hardware components . However , the software generating and interpreting the modem tones to be sent to the softmodem uses many system resources . For online gaming , this can be a real concern . Another problem is the lack of cross-platform compatibility , meaning that non-Windows operating systems ( such as Linux ) often do not have an equivalent driver to operate the modem . List	Modem

837105854_33270-33831	ADSL ( asymmetric digital subscriber line ) modems , a more recent development , are not limited to the telephone 's voiceband audio frequencies . Standard twisted - pair telephone cable can , for short distances , carry signals with much higher frequencies than the cable 's maximum frequency rating . ADSL broadband takes advantage of this capability . However , ADSL 's performance gradually declines as the telephone cable 's length increases . This limits ADSL broadband service to subscribers within a relatively short distance of the telephone exchange .	Modem

However , many people knew that a modem connected a computer to the Internet over a telephone line . To take advantage of consumers ' familiarity with modems , companies called these devices broadband modems rather than using less familiar terms such as adapter , interface , transceiver , or bridge . In fact , broadband modems fit the definition of modem because they use complex waveforms to carry digital data . They use more advanced technology than dial - up modems : typically they can modulate and demodulate hundreds of channels simultaneously or use much wider channels than dial - up modems .	Modem

Modern telecommunications and data networks also make extensive use of radio modems where long distance data links are required . Such systems are an important part of the PSTN , and are also in common use for high - speed computer network links to outlying areas where fibre is not economical .	Modem
837105854_35583-36338	Even where a cable is installed , it is often possible to get better performance or make other parts of the system simpler by using radio frequencies and modulation techniques through a cable . Coaxial cable has a very large bandwidth , but signal attenuation becomes a major problem at high data rates if a baseband digital signal is used . By using a modem , a much larger amount of digital data can be transmitted through a single wire . Digital cable television and cable Internet services use radio frequency modems to provide the increasing bandwidth needs of modern households . Using a modem also allows for frequency - division multiple access to be used , making full - duplex digital communication with many users possible using a single wire .	Modem
837105854_36339-36648	Wireless modems come in a variety of types , bandwidths , and speeds . Wireless modems are often referred to as transparent or smart .

Typically , they were half duplex , meaning that they could not send and receive data at the same time . Typically , transparent modems are polled in a round robin manner to collect small amounts of data from scattered locations that do not have easy access to wired infrastructure . Transparent modems are most commonly used by utility companies for data collection .	Modem

837105854_38432-39609	Modems which use a mobile telephone system ( GPRS , UMTS , HSPA , EVDO , WiMax , etc . ) , are known as mobile broadband modems ( sometimes also called wireless modems ) . Wireless modems can be embedded inside a laptop or appliance , or be external to it . External wireless modems are connect cards , USB modems for mobile broadband and cellular routers . A connect card is a PC Card or ExpressCard which slides into a PCMCIA / PC card / ExpressCard slot on a computer . USB wireless modems use a USB port on the laptop instead of a PC card or ExpressCard slot . A USB modem used for mobile broadband Internet is also sometimes referred to as a dongle . A cellular router may have an external datacard ( AirCard ) that slides into it . Most cellular routers do allow such datacards or USB modems . Cellular routers may not be modems by definition , but they contain modems or allow modems to be slid into them . The difference between a cellular router and a wireless modem is that a cellular router normally allows multiple people to connect to it ( since it can route data or support multi-point to multi-point connections ) , while a modem is designed for one connection .

829955941_123-381	Eukaryotic DNA replication is a conserved mechanism that restricts DNA replication to once per cell cycle . Eukaryotic DNA replication of chromosomal DNA is central for the duplication of a cell and is necessary for the maintenance of the eukaryotic genome .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_382-1106	DNA replication is the action of DNA polymerases synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to the original template strand . To synthesize DNA , the double - stranded DNA is unwound by DNA helicases ahead of polymerases , forming a replication fork containing two single - stranded templates . Replication processes permit the copying of a single DNA double helix into two DNA helices , which are divided into the daughter cells at mitosis . The major enzymatic functions carried out at the replication fork are well conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes , but the replication machinery in eukaryotic DNA replication is a much larger complex , coordinating many proteins at the site of replication , forming the replisome .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_1107-1462	The replisome is responsible for copying the entirety of genomic DNA in each proliferative cell . This process allows for the high - fidelity passage of hereditary / genetic information from parental cell to daughter cell and is thus essential to all organisms . Much of the cell cycle is built around ensuring that DNA replication occurs without errors .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_1463-2006	In G phase of the cell cycle , many of the DNA replication regulatory processes are initiated . In eukaryotes , the vast majority of DNA synthesis occurs during S phase of the cell cycle , and the entire genome must be unwound and duplicated to form two daughter copies . During G , any damaged DNA or replication errors are corrected . Finally , one copy of the genomes is segregated to each daughter cell at mitosis or M phase . These daughter copies each contain one strand from the parental duplex DNA and one nascent antiparallel strand .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_2007-2429	This mechanism is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and is known as semiconservative DNA replication . The process of semiconservative replication for the site of DNA replication is a fork - like DNA structure , the replication fork , where the DNA helix is open , or unwound , exposing unpaired DNA nucleotides for recognition and base pairing for the incorporation of free nucleotides into double - stranded DNA .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_3346-3846	Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication is the first stage of DNA synthesis where the DNA double helix is unwound and an initial priming event by DNA polymerase α occurs on the leading strand . The priming event on the lagging strand establishes a replication fork . Priming of the DNA helix consists of synthesis of an RNA primer to allow DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase α . Priming occurs once at the origin on the leading strand and at the start of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_3847-4288	DNA replication is initiated from specific sequences called origins of replication , and eukaryotic cells have multiple replication origins . To initiate DNA replication , multiple replicative proteins assemble on and dissociate from these replicative origins . The individual factors described below work together to direct the formation of the pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) , a key intermediate in the replication initiation process .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_4289-4848	Association of the origin recognition complex ( ORC ) with a replication origin is required to recruit both cell division cycle 6 protein ( Cdc6 ) and chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 protein ( Cdt1 ) , which initiate the assembly of the pre-RC . Both Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins associate with the already bound ORC independently from each other . The ORC , Cdc6 , and Cdt1 together are required for the stable association of the minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm 2 - 7 ) complex proteins with replicative origins during G phase of the cell cycle .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_5590-6586	Eukaryotic origins of replication control the formation of a number of protein complexes that lead to the assembly of two bidirectional DNA replication forks . These events are initiated by the formation of the pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) at the origins of replication . This process takes place in the G stage of the cell cycle . The pre-RC formation involves the ordered assembly of many replication factors including the origin recognition complex ( ORC ) , Cdc6 protein , Cdt1 protein , and minichromosome maintenance proteins ( Mcm2 - 7 ) . Once the pre-RC is formed , activation of the complex is triggered by two kinases , cyclin - dependent kinase 2 ( CDK ) and Dbf4 - dependent kinase ( DDK ) that help transition the pre-RC to the initiation complex prior to the initiation of DNA replication . This transition involves the ordered assembly of additional replication factors to unwind the DNA and accumulate the multiple eukaryotic DNA polymerases around the unwound DNA . Origin	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_6658-7414	The first step in the assembly of the pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) is the binding of the origin recognition complex ( ORC ) to the replication origin . In late mitosis , Cdc6 protein joins the bound ORC followed by the binding of the Cdt1 protein . ORC , Cdc6 , and Cdt1 are all required to load the six protein minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm 2 - 7 ) complex onto the DNA . The ORC is a six - subunit , Orc1p - 6 , protein complex that selects the replicative origin sites on DNA for initiation of replication and ORC binding to chromatin is regulated through the cell cycle . Generally , the function and size of the ORC subunits are conserved throughout many eukaryotic genomes with the difference being which ORC unit actually contacts the DNA .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_7415-7778	The most widely studied origin recognition complex is that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or yeast which is known to bind to the autonomously replicating sequence ( ARS ) . The S. cerevisiae ORC interacts specifically with both the A and B1 elements of yeast origins of replication , spanning a region of 30 base pairs . The binding to these sequences requires ATP .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_7779-8398	The S. cerevisiae ORC requires the five largest subunits , Orc1 , Orc2 , Orc3 , Orc4 , and Orc5 , to recognize DNA , four of which ( Orc1p , 2p , 4p , and 5p ) remain in close contact with the origin . The Orc1 and Orc5 subunits are known to interact with ATP , but only the interaction between the Orc1 subunit and ATP are required for DNA binding . The S. cerevisiae Orc1 subunit also hydrolyzes ATP ; however ATP hydrolysis is not required for DNA binding . Once the ORC is bound to the origin , the complex is retained in an ATP - bound state and the ATP hydrolysis is reserved for a downstream step in initiation .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_8399-8653	When the ORC binds to DNA at replication origins , it then serves as a scaffold for the assembly of other key initiation factors of the pre-replicative complex , which includes Cdc6 , Cdt1 , and minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm 2 - 7 ) complex proteins .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_8654-9126	This pre-replicative complex assembly during the G stage of the cell cycle is required prior to the continuation of DNA replication during the S phase . The regulation of mammalian ORC is consistent with the removal of at least part of the complex from the chromosome at metaphase . The Orc1 associated with chromatin is released during mitosis . The removal of ORC could serve to eliminate the pre-replicative complex formation prior to the completion of metaphase . Cdc6	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_9164-9929	Binding of the cell division cycle 6 ( Cdc6 ) protein to the origin recognition complex ( ORC ) is an essential step in the assembly of the pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) at the origins of replication . Cdc6 binds to the ORC on DNA in an ATP - dependent manner , which induces a change in the pattern of origin binding that requires Orc10 ATPase . Cdc6 requires ORC in order to associate with chromatin and is in turn required for the minichromosome maintenance proteins ( Mcm2 - 7 ) to bind to the chromatin . The ORC - Cdc6 complex forms a ring - shaped structure and is analogous to other ATP - dependent protein machines . The levels and activity of Cdc6 regulate the frequency with which the origins of replication are utilized during the cell cycle . Cdt1	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_9990-10755	In fission yeast and Xenopus , chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 ( Cdt1 ) protein is required for the licensing of chromatin for DNA replication . Cdt1 is essential for DNA replication and performs its role during the formation of the pre-replicative complex by loading the minichromosome maintenance proteins ( Mcm ) onto the chromosome . Cdt1 has been shown to associate with the C terminus of Cdc6 to cooperatively promote the association of Mcm proteins to the chromatin . Cdt1 activity during the cell cycle is tightly regulated by its association with the protein geminin , which both inhibits Cdt1 activity during S phase in order to prevent re-replication of DNA and prevents it from ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis . Minichromosome	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_10835-11349	The assembly of the minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm ) proteins function together as a complex in the cell . The assembly of the Mcm proteins onto chromatin requires the coordinated function of the origin recognition complex ( ORC ) , Cdc6 , and Cdt1 . Once the Mcm proteins have been loaded onto the chromatin , ORC and Cdc6 can be removed from the chromatin without preventing subsequent DNA replication . This suggests that the primary role of the pre-replication complex is to correctly load the Mcm proteins .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_11350-11780	The Mcm proteins support roles both in the initiation and elongation steps of DNA synthesis . Each Mcm protein is highly related to all others , but unique sequences distinguishing each of the subunit types are conserved across eukaryotes . All eukaryotes have exactly six Mcm protein analogs that each fall into one of the existing classes ( Mcm2 - 7 ) , which suggests that each Mcm protein has a unique and important function .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_11781-12539	Minichromosome maintenance proteins have been found to be required for DNA helicase activity and inactivation of any of the six Mcm proteins prevents further progression of the replication fork . This is consistent with the requirement of ORC , Cdc6 , and Cdt1 function to assemble the Mcm proteins at the origin of replication . The complex containing all six Mcm proteins creates a hexameric , doughnut like structure with a central cavity . The helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex raises the question of how the ring - like complex is loaded onto the single - stranded DNA . One possibility is that the helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex can oscillate between an open and a closed ring formation to allow single - stranded DNA loading .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_12540-13498	Along with the minichromosome maintenance protein complex helicase activity , the complex also has associated ATPase activity . A mutation in any one of the six Mcm proteins reduces the conserved ATP binding sites , which indicates that ATP hydrolysis is a coordinated event involving all six subunits of the Mcm complex . Studies have shown that within the Mcm protein complex are specific catalytic pairs of Mcm proteins that function together to coordinate ATP hydrolysis . For example , Mcm3 but not Mcm6 can activate Mcm6 activity . These studies suggest that the structure for the Mcm complex is a hexamer with Mcm3 next to Mcm7 , Mcm2 next to Mcm6 , and Mcm4 next to Mcm5 . Both members of the catalytic pair contribute to the conformation that allows ATP binding and hydrolysis and the mixture of active and inactive subunits create a coordinated ATPase activity that allows the Mcm protein complex to complete ATP binding and hydrolysis as a whole .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_13499-14073	The nuclear localization of the minichromosome maintenance proteins is regulated in budding yeast cells . The Mcm proteins are present in the nucleus in G stage and S phase of the cell cycle , but are exported to the cytoplasm during the G stage and M phase . A complete and intact six subunit Mcm complex is required to enter into the cell nucleus . In S. cerevisiae , nuclear export is promoted by cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) activity . Mcm proteins that are associated with chromatin are protected from CDK export machinery due to the lack of accessibility to CDK .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_14102-15201	During the G stage of the cell cycle , the replication initiation factors , origin recognition complex ( ORC ) , Cdc6 , Cdt1 , and minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm ) protein complex , bind sequentially to DNA to form the pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) . At the transition of the G stage to the S phase of the cell cycle , S phase -- specific cyclin - dependent protein kinase ( CDK ) and Cdc7 / Dbf4 kinase ( DDK ) transform the pre-RC into an active replication fork . During this transformation , the pre-RC is disassembled with the loss of Cdc6 , creating the initiation complex . In addition to the binding of the Mcm proteins , cell division cycle 45 ( Cdc45 ) protein is also essential for initiating DNA replication . Studies have shown that Mcm is critical for the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin and this complex containing both Mcm and Cdc45 is formed at the onset of the S phase of the cell cycle . Cdc45 targets the Mcm protein complex , which has been loaded onto the chromatin , as a component of the pre-RC at the origin of replication during the G stage of the cell cycle . Cdc45	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_15258-15691	Cell division cycle 45 ( Cdc45 ) protein is a critical component for the conversion of the pre-replicative complex to the initiation complex . The Cdc45 protein assembles at replication origins before initiation and is required for replication to begin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and has an essential role during elongation . Thus , Cdc45 has central roles in both initiation and elongation phases of chromosomal DNA replication .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_15692-16471	Cdc45 associates with chromatin after the beginning of initiation in late G stage and during the S phase of the cell cycle . Cdc45 physically associates with Mcm5 and displays genetic interactions with five of the six members of the Mcm gene family and the ORC2 gene . The loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin is critical for loading other various replication proteins , including DNA polymerase α , DNA polymerase ε , replication protein A ( RPA ) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) onto chromatin . Within a Xenopus nucleus - free system , it has been demonstrated that Cdc45 is required for the unwinding of plasmid DNA . The Xenopus nucleus - free system also demonstrates that DNA unwinding and tight RPA binding to chromatin occurs only in the presence of Cdc45 .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_16472-17076	Binding of Cdc45 to chromatin depends on Clb - Cdc28 kinase activity as well as functional Cdc6 and Mcm2 , which suggests that Cdc45 associates with the pre-RC after activation of S - phase cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDKs ) . As indicated by the timing and the CDK dependence , binding of Cdc45 to chromatin is crucial for commitment to initiation of DNA replication . During S phase , Cdc45 physically interacts with Mcm proteins on chromatin ; however , dissociation of Cdc45 from chromatin is slower than that of Mcm 's , which indicates that the proteins are released by different mechanisms . GINS	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_17126-17680	The six minichromosome maintenance proteins and Cdc45 are essential during initiation and elongation for the movement of replication forks and for unwinding of the DNA . GINS are essential for the interaction of Mcm and Cdc45 at the origins of replication during initiation and then at DNA replication forks as the replisome progresses . The GINS complex is composed of four small proteins Sld5 ( Cdc105 ) , Psf1 ( Cdc101 ) , Psf2 ( Cdc102 ) and Psf3 ( Cdc103 ) , GINS represents ' go , ichi , ni , san ' which means ' 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 ' in Japanese . Mcm10	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_17711-17978	Mcm10 is essential for chromosome replication and interacts with the minichromosome maintenance 2 - 7 helicase that is loaded in an inactive form at origins of DNA replication . Mcm10 chaperones the catalytic DNA polymerase α and helps stabilize the polymerase . DDK	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_18045-18755	At the onset of S phase , the pre-replicative complex must be activated by two S phase - specific kinases in order to form an initiation complex at an origin of replication . One kinase is the Cdc7 - Dbf4 kinase called Dbf4 - dependent kinase ( DDK ) and the other is cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) . Chromatin - binding assays of Cdc45 in yeast and Xenopus have shown that a downstream event of CDK action is loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin . Cdc6 has been speculated to be a target of CDK action , because of the association between Cdc6 and CDK , and the CDK - dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6 . The CDK - dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6 has been considered to be required for entry into the S phase .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_18756-19220	Both the catalytic subunits of DDK and Cdc7 , and the activator protein , Dbf4 , are conserved in eukaryotes and are required for the onset of S phase of the cell cycle . Both DDK and Cdc7 are required for the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin origins of replication . The target for binding of the DDK kinase is the Mcm complex , possibly Mcm2 . DDK targets the Mcm complex , and its phosphorylation leads to the possible activation of Mcm helicase activity . Dpb11	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_19257-19724	Sld3 , Sld2 , and Dpb11 interact with many replication proteins . Sld3 and Cdc45 form a complex that associated with the pre-RC at the early origins of replication even in the G1 phase and with the later origins of replication in the S phase in a mutually Mcm - dependent manner . Dpb11 and Sld2 interact with Polymerase ɛ and cross-linking experiments have indicated that Dpb11 and Polymerase ɛ coprecipitate in the S phase and associate with replication origins .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_19725-20169	Sld3 and Sld2 are phosphorylated by CDK , which enables the two replicative proteins to bind to Dpb11 . Dpb11 had two pairs of BRCA1 C Terminus ( BRCT ) domains which are known as a phosphopeptide - binding domains . The N - terminal pair of the BRCT domains binds to phosphorylated Sld3 , and the C - terminal pair binds to phosphorylated Sld2 . Both of these interactions are essential for CDK - dependent activation of DNA budding in yeast .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_20170-20402	Dpb11 also interacts with GINS and participates in the initiation and elongation steps of chromosomal DNA replication . GINS are one of the replication proteins found at the replication forks and forms a complex with Cdc45 and Mcm .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_20403-20958	These phosphorylation - dependent interactions between Dpb11 , Sld2 , and Sld3 are essential for CDK - dependent activation of DNA replication , and by using cross-linking reagents within some experiments , a fragile complex was identified called the pre-loading complex ( pre-LC ) . This complex contains Pol ɛ , GINS , Sld2 , and Dpb11 . The pre-LC is found to form before any association with the origins in a CDK - dependent and DDK - dependent manner and CDK activity regulates the initiation of DNA replication through the formation of the pre-LC .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_21059-21582	The formation of the pre-replicative complex ( pre-RC ) marks the potential sites for the initiation of DNA replication . Consistent with the minichromosome maintenance complex encircling double stranded DNA , formation of the pre-RC does not lead to the immediate unwinding of origin DNA or the recruitment of DNA polymerases . Instead , the pre-RC that is formed during the G of the cell cycle is only activated to unwind the DNA and initiate replication after the cells pass from the G to the S phase of the cell cycle .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_21583-22480	Once the initiation complex is formed and the cells pass into the S phase , the complex then becomes a replisome . The eukaryotic replisome complex is responsible for coordinating DNA replication . Replication on the leading and lagging strands is performed by DNA polymerase ε and DNA polymerase δ . Many replisome factors including Claspin , And1 , replication factor C clamp loader and the fork protection complex are responsible for regulating polymerase functions and coordinating DNA synthesis with the unwinding of the template strand by Cdc45 - Mcm - GINS complex . As the DNA is unwound the twist number decreases . To compensate for this the writhe number increases , introducing positive supercoils in the DNA . These supercoils would cause DNA replication to halt if they were not removed . Topoisomerases are responsible for removing these supercoils ahead of the replication fork .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_22481-23630	The replisome is responsible for copying the entire genomic DNA in each proliferative cell . The base pairing and chain formation reactions , which form the daughter helix , are catalyzed by DNA polymerases . These enzymes move along single - stranded DNA and allow for the extension of the nascent DNA strand by `` reading '' the template strand and allowing for incorporation of the proper purine nucleobases , adenine and guanine , and pyrimidine nucleobases , thymine and cytosine . Activated free deoxyribonucleotides exist in the cell as deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ( dNTPs ) . These free nucleotides are added to an exposed 3 ' - hydroxyl group on the last incorporated nucleotide . In this reaction , a pyrophosphate is released from the free dNTP , generating energy for the polymerization reaction and exposing the 5 ' monophosphate , which is then covalently bonded to the 3 ' oxygen . Additionally , incorrectly inserted nucleotides can be removed and replaced by the correct nucleotides in an energetically favorable reaction . This property is vital to proper proofreading and repair of errors that occur during DNA replication .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_23657-24501	The replication fork is the junction between the newly separated template strands , known as the leading and lagging strands , and the double stranded DNA . Since duplex DNA is antiparallel , DNA replication occurs in opposite directions between the two new strands at the replication fork , but all DNA polymerases synthesize DNA in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction with respect to the newly synthesized strand . Further coordination is required during DNA replication . Two replicative polymerases synthesize DNA in opposite orientations . Polymerase ε synthesizes DNA on the `` leading '' DNA strand continuously as it is pointing in the same direction as DNA unwinding by the replisome . In contrast , polymerase δ synthesizes DNA on the `` lagging '' strand , which is the opposite DNA template strand , in a fragmented or discontinuous manner .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_24502-25048	The discontinuous stretches of DNA replication products on the lagging strand are known as Okazaki fragments and are about 100 to 200 bases in length at eukaryotic replication forks . The lagging strand usually contains longer stretches of single - stranded DNA that is coated with single - stranded binding proteins , which help stabilize the single - stranded templates by preventing a secondary structure formation . In eukaryotes , these single - stranded binding proteins are a heterotrimeric complex known as replication protein A ( RPA ) .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_25049-26186	Each Okazaki fragment is preceded by an RNA primer , which is displaced by the procession of the next Okazaki fragment during synthesis . RNase H recognizes the DNA : RNA hybrids that are created by the use of RNA primers and is responsible for removing these from the replicated strand , leaving behind a primer : template junction . DNA polymerase α , recognizes these sites and elongates the breaks left by primer removal . In eukaryotic cells , a small amount of the DNA segment immediately upstream of the RNA primer is also displaced , creating a flap structure . This flap is then cleaved by endonucleases . At the replication fork , the gap in DNA after removal of the flap is sealed by DNA ligase I , which repairs the nicks that are left between the 3 ' - OH and 5'phosphate of the newly synthesized strand . Owing to the relatively short nature of the eukaryotic Okazaki fragment , DNA replication synthesis occurring discontinuously on the lagging strand is less efficient and more time consuming than leading - strand synthesis . DNA synthesis is complete once all RNA primers are removed and nicks are repaired . Depiction	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_26378-26841	During DNA replication , the replisome will unwind the parental duplex DNA into a two single - stranded DNA template replication fork in a 5 ' to 3 ' direction . The leading strand is the template strand that is being replicated in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork . This allows the newly synthesized strand complementary to the original strand to be synthesized 5 ' to 3 ' in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_26842-27229	Once an RNA primer has been added by a primase to the 3 ' end of the leading strand , DNA synthesis will continue in a 3 ' to 5 ' direction with respect to the leading strand uninterrupted . DNA Polymerase ε will continuously add nucleotides to the template strand therefore making leading strand synthesis require only one primer and has uninterrupted DNA polymerase activity . Lagging	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_27246-27666	DNA replication on the lagging strand is discontinuous . In lagging strand synthesis , the movement of DNA polymerase in the opposite direction of the replication fork requires the use of multiple RNA primers . DNA polymerase will synthesize short fragments of DNA called Okazaki fragments which are added to the 3 ' end of the primer . These fragments can be anywhere between 100 -- 400 nucleotides long in eukaryotes .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_27667-28395	At the end of Okazaki fragment synthesis , DNA polymerase δ runs into the previous Okazaki fragment and displaces its 5 ' end containing the RNA primer and a small segment of DNA . This generates an RNA - DNA single strand flap , which must be cleaved , and the nick between the two Okazaki fragments must be sealed by DNA ligase I . This process is known as Okazaki fragment maturation and can be handled in two ways : one mechanism processes short flaps , while the other deals with long flaps . DNA polymerase δ is able to displace up to 2 to 3 nucleotides of DNA or RNA ahead of its polymerization , generating a short `` flap '' substrate for Fen1 , which can remove nucleotides from the flap , one nucleotide at a time .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_28396-29291	By repeating cycles of this process , DNA polymerase δ and Fen1 can coordinate the removal of RNA primers and leave a DNA nick at the lagging strand . It has been proposed that this iterative process is preferable to the cell because it is tightly regulated and does not generate large flaps that need to be excised . In the event of deregulated Fen1 / DNA polymerase δ activity , the cell uses an alternative mechanism to generate and process long flaps by using Dna2 , which has both helicase and nuclease activities . The nuclease activity of Dna2 is required for removing these long flaps , leaving a shorter flap to be processed by Fen1 . Electron microscopy studies indicate that nucleosome loading on the lagging strand occurs very close to the site of synthesis . Thus , Okazaki fragment maturation is an efficient process that occurs immediately after the nascent DNA is synthesized .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_29329-29902	After the replicative helicase has unwound the parental DNA duplex , exposing two single - stranded DNA templates , replicative polymerases are needed to generate two copies of the parental genome . DNA polymerase function is highly specialized and accomplish replication on specific templates and in narrow localizations . At the eukaryotic replication fork , there are three distinct replicative polymerase complexes that contribute to DNA replication : Polymerase α , Polymerase δ , and Polymerase ε . These three polymerases are essential for viability of the cell .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_29903-30418	Because DNA polymerases require a primer on which to begin DNA synthesis , polymerase α ( Pol α ) acts as a replicative primase . Pol α is associated with an RNA primase and this complex accomplishes the priming task by synthesizing a primer that contains a short 10 nucleotide stretch of RNA followed by 10 to 20 DNA bases . Importantly , this priming action occurs at replication initiation at origins to begin leading - strand synthesis and also at the 5 ' end of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_30419-30895	However , Pol α is not able to continue DNA replication and must be replaced with another polymerase to continue DNA synthesis . Polymerase switching requires clamp loaders and it has been proven that normal DNA replication requires the coordinated actions of all three DNA polymerases : Pol α for priming synthesis , Pol ε for leading - strand replication , and the Pol δ , which is constantly loaded , for generating Okazaki fragments during lagging - strand synthesis .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_30896-31859	Polymerase α ( Pol α ) : Forms a complex with a small catalytic subunit ( PriS ) and a large noncatalytic ( PriL ) subunit . First , synthesis of an RNA primer allows DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase alpha . Occurs once at the origin on the leading strand and at the start of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand . Pri subunits act as a primase , synthesizing an RNA primer . DNA Pol α elongates the newly formed primer with DNA nucleotides . After around 20 nucleotides , elongation is taken over by Pol ε on the leading strand and Pol δ on the lagging strand . Polymerase δ ( Pol δ ) : Highly processive and has proofreading , 3 ' - > 5 ' exonuclease activity . In vivo , it is the main polymerase involved in both lagging strand and leading strand synthesis . Polymerase ε ( Pol ε ) : Highly processive and has proofreading , 3 ' - > 5 ' exonuclease activity . Highly related to pol δ , in vivo it functions mainly in error checking of pol δ .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_31907-32513	The DNA helicases and polymerases must remain in close contact at the replication fork . If unwinding occurs too far in advance of synthesis , large tracts of single - stranded DNA are exposed . This can activate DNA damage signaling or induce DNA repair processes . To thwart these problems , the eukaryotic replisome contains specialized proteins that are designed to regulate the helicase activity ahead of the replication fork . These proteins also provide docking sites for physical interaction between helicases and polymerases , thereby ensuring that duplex unwinding is coupled with DNA synthesis .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_32514-33326	For DNA polymerases to function , the double - stranded DNA helix has to be unwound to expose two single - stranded DNA templates for replication . DNA helicases are responsible for unwinding the double - stranded DNA during chromosome replication . Helicases in eukaryotic cells are remarkably complex . The catalytic core of the helicase is composed of six minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm2 - 7 ) proteins , forming a hexameric ring . Away from DNA , the Mcm2 - 7 proteins form a single heterohexamer and are loaded in an inactive form at origins of DNA replication as a head - to - head double hexamers around double - stranded DNA . The Mcm proteins are recruited to replication origins then redistributed throughout the genomic DNA during S phase , indicative of their localization to the replication fork .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_33327-33952	Loading of Mcm proteins can only occur during the G of the cell cycle , and the loaded complex is then activated during S phase by recruitment of the Cdc45 protein and the GINS complex to form the active Cdc45 -- Mcm -- GINS ( CMG ) helicase at DNA replication forks . Mcm activity is required throughout the S phase for DNA replication . A variety of regulatory factors assemble around the CMG helicase to produce the ' Replisome Progression Complex ' which associates with DNA polymerases to form the eukaryotic replisome , the structure of which is still quite poorly defined in comparison with its bacterial counterpart .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_33953-34490	The isolated CMG helicase and Replisome Progression Complex contain a single Mcm protein ring complex suggesting that the loaded double hexamer of the Mcm proteins at origins might be broken into two single hexameric rings as part of the initiation process , with each Mcm protein complex ring forming the core of a CMG helicase at the two replication forks established from each origin . The full CMG complex is required for DNA unwinding , and the complex of CDC45 - Mcm - GINS is the functional DNA helicase in eukaryotic cells . Ctf4	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_34518-34824	The CMG complex interacts with the replisome through the interaction with Ctf4 and And1 proteins . Ctf4 / And1 proteins interact with both the CMG complex and DNA polymerase α . Ctf4 is a polymerase α accessory factor , which is required for the recruitment of polymerase α to replication origins . Mrc1	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_34855-35363	Mrc1 / Claspin proteins couple leading - strand synthesis with the CMG complex helicase activity . Mrc1 interacts with polymerase ε as well as Mcm proteins . The importance of this direct link between the helicase and the leading - strand polymerase is underscored by results in cultured human cells , where Mrc1 / Claspin is required for efficient replication fork progression . These results suggest that efficient DNA replication also requires the coupling of helicases and leading - strand synthesis ...	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_35458-35948	DNA polymerases require additional factors to support DNA replication . DNA polymerases have a semiclosed ' hand ' structure , which allows the polymerase to load onto the DNA and begin translocating . This structure permits DNA polymerase to hold the single - stranded DNA template , incorporate dNTPs at the active site , and release the newly formed double - stranded DNA . However , the structure of DNA polymerases does not allow a continuous stable interaction with the template DNA .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_35949-36815	To strengthen the interaction between the polymerase and the template DNA , DNA sliding clamps associate with the polymerase to promote the processivity of the replicative polymerase . In eukaryotes , the sliding clamp is a homotrimer ring structure known as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) . The PCNA ring has polarity with surfaces that interact with DNA polymerases and tethers them securely to the DNA template . PCNA - dependent stabilization of DNA polymerases has a significant effect on DNA replication because PCNAs are able to enhance the polymerase processivity up to 1,000-fold . PCNA is an essential cofactor and has the distinction of being one of the most common interaction platforms in the replisome to accommodate multiple processes at the replication fork , and so PCNA is also viewed as a regulatory cofactor for DNA polymerases .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_36846-37350	PCNA fully encircles the DNA template strand and must be loaded onto DNA at the replication fork . At the leading strand , loading of the PCNA is an infrequent process , because DNA replication on the leading strand is continuous until replication is terminated . However , at the lagging strand , DNA polymerase δ needs to be continually loaded at the start of each Okazaki fragment . This constant initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis requires repeated PCNA loading for efficient DNA replication .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_37351-37847	PCNA loading is accomplished by the replication factor C ( RFC ) complex . The RFC complex is composed of five ATPases : Rfc1 , Rfc2 , Rfc3 , Rfc4 and Rfc5 . RFC recognizes primer - template junctions and loads PCNA at these sites . The PCNA homotrimer is opened by RFC by ATP hydrolysis and is then loaded onto DNA in the proper orientation to facilitate its association with the polymerase . Clamp loaders can also unload PCNA from DNA ; a mechanism needed when replication must be terminated .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_37882-38412	DNA replication at the replication fork can be halted by a shortage of deoxynucleotide triphosphates ( dNTPs ) or by DNA damage , resulting in replication stress . This halting of replication is described as a stalled replication fork . A fork protection complex of proteins stabilizes the replication fork until DNA damage or other replication problems can be fixed . Prolonged replication fork stalling can lead to further DNA damage . Stalling signals are deactivated if the problems causing the replication fork are resolved .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_38501-39009	Termination of eukaryotic DNA replication requires different processes depending on whether the chromosomes are circular or linear . Unlike linear molecules , circular chromosomes are able to replicate the entire molecule . However , the two DNA molecules will remain linked together . This issue is handled by decatenation of the two DNA molecules by a type II topoisomerase . Type II topoisomerases are also used to separate linear strands as they are intricately folded into a nucleosome within the cell .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_39010-40070	As previously mentioned , linear chromosomes face another issue that is not seen in circular DNA replication . Due to the fact that an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis , the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome . While the leading strand can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5 ' terminus of the replicating DNA strand , multiple RNA primers are responsible for lagging strand synthesis , creating Okazaki fragments . This leads to an issue due to the fact that DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3 ' end of the DNA strand . The 3 ' - 5 ' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) region at the 3 ' end of the parent strand when the Okazaki fragments have been repaired . Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes , each strand is a lagging strand at one end . Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes . This is known as the end replication problem .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_40071-41146	The end replication problem is handled in eukaryotic cells by telomere regions and telomerase . Telomeres extend the 3 ' end of the parental chromosome beyond the 5 ' end of the daughter strand . This single - stranded DNA structure can act as an origin of replication that recruits telomerase . Telomerase is a specialized DNA polymerase that consists of multiple protein subunits and an RNA component . The RNA component of telomerase anneals to the single stranded 3 ' end of the template DNA and contains 1.5 copies of the telomeric sequence . Telomerase contains a protein subunit that is a reverse transcriptase called telomerase reverse transcriptase or TERT . TERT synthesizes DNA until the end of the template telomerase RNA and then disengages . This process can be repeated as many times as needed with the extension of the 3 ' end of the parental DNA molecule . This 3 ' addition provides a template for extension of the 5 ' end of the daughter strand by lagging strand DNA synthesis . Regulation of telomerase activity is handled by telomere - binding proteins .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_41182-41777	Eukaryotic DNA replication is bidirectional ; within a replicative origin , replisome complexes are created at each end of the replication origin and replisomes move away from each other from the initial starting point . In prokaryotes , bidirectional replication initiates at one replicative origin on the circular chromosome and terminates at a site opposed from the initial start of the origin . These termination regions have DNA sequences known as Ter sites . These Ter sites are bound by the Tus protein . The Ter - Tus complex is able to stop helicase activity , terminating replication .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_41778-42433	In eukaryotic cells , termination of replication usually occurs through the collision of the two replicative forks between two active replication origins . The location of the collision varies on the timing of origin firing . In this way , if a replication fork becomes stalled or collapses at a certain site , replication of the site can be rescued when a replisome traveling in the opposite direction completes copying the region . There are programmed replication fork barriers ( RFBs ) bound by RFB proteins in various locations , throughout the genome , which are able to terminate or pause replication forks , stopping progression of the replisome .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_42503-43009	DNA replication is a tightly orchestrated process that is controlled within the context of the cell cycle . Progress through the cell cycle and in turn DNA replication is tightly regulated by the formation and activation of pre-replicative complexs ( pre-RCs ) which is achieved through the activation and inactivation of cyclin - dependent kinases ( Cdks , CDKs ) . Specifically it is the interactions of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases that are responsible for the transition from G into S - phase .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_43010-43782	During the G phase of the cell cycle there are low levels of CDK activity . This low level of CDK activity allows for the formation of new pre-RC complexes but is not sufficient for DNA replication to be initiated by the newly formed pre-RCs . During the remaining phases of the cell cycle there are elevated levels of CDK activity . This high level of CDK activity is responsible for initiating DNA replication as well as inhibiting new pre-RC complex formation . Once DNA replication has been initiated the pre-RC complex is broken down . Due to the fact that CDK levels remain high during the S phase , G , and M phases of the cell cycle no new pre-RC complexes can be formed . This all helps to ensure that no initiation can occur until the cell division is complete .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_43783-44281	In addition to cyclin dependent kinases a new round of replication is thought to be prevented through the downregulation of Cdt1 . This is achieved via degradation of Cdt1 as well as through the inhibitory actions of a protein known as geminin . Geminin binds tightly to Cdt1 and is thought to be the major inhibitor of re-replication . Geminin first appears in S - phase and is degraded at the metaphase - anaphase transition , possibly through ubiquination by anaphase promoting complex ( APC ) .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_44282-44868	Various cell cycle checkpoints are present throughout the course of the cell cycle that determine whether a cell will progress through division entirely . Importantly in replication the G , or restriction , checkpoint makes the determination of whether or not initiation of replication will begin or whether the cell will be placed in a resting stage known as G. Cells in the G stage of the cell cycle are prevented from initiating a round of replication because the minichromosome maintenance proteins are not expressed . Transition into the S - phase indicates replication has begun .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_44910-45647	In order to preserve genetic information during cell division , DNA replication must be completed with high fidelity . In order to achieve this task , eukaryotic cells have proteins in place during certain points in the replication process that are able to detect any errors during DNA replication and are able to preserve genomic integrity . These checkpoint proteins are able to stop the cell cycle from entering mitosis in order to allow time for DNA repair . Checkpoint proteins are also involved in some DNA repair pathways , while they stabilize the structure of the replication fork to prevent further damage . These checkpoint proteins are essential to avoid passing down mutations or other chromosomal aberrations to offspring .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_45648-45913	Eukaryotic checkpoint proteins are well conserved and involve two phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase - related kinases ( PIKKs ) , ATR and ATM . Both ATR and ATM share a target phosphorylation sequence , the SQ / TQ motif , but their individual roles in cells differ .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_45914-46466	ATR is involved in arresting the cell cycle in response to DNA double - stranded breaks . ATR has an obligate checkpoint partner , ATR - interacting - protein ( ATRIP ) , and together these two proteins are responsive to stretches of single - stranded DNA that are coated by replication protein A ( RPA ) . The formation of single - stranded DNA occurs frequently , more often during replication stress . ATR - ATRIP is able to arrest the cell cycle to preserve genome integrity . ATR is found on chromatin during S phase , similar to RPA and claspin .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_46467-47766	The generation of single - stranded DNA tracts is important in initiating the checkpoint pathways downstream of replication damage . Once single - stranded DNA becomes sufficiently long , single - stranded DNA coated with RPA are able to recruit ATR - ATRIP . In order to become fully active , the ATR kinase rely on sensor proteins that sense whether the checkpoint proteins are localized to a valid site of DNA replication stress . The RAD9 - HUS1 - Rad1 ( 9 - 1 - 1 ) heterotrimeric clamp and its clamp loader RFC are able to recognize gapped or nicked DNA . The RFC clamp loader loads 9 - 1 - 1 onto the damaged DNA . The presence of 9 - 1 - 1 on DNA is enough to facilitate the interaction between ATR - ATRIP and a group of proteins termed checkpoint mediators , such as TOPBP1 and Mrc1 / claspin . TOPBP1 interacts with and recruits the phosphorylated Rad9 component of 9 - 1 - 1 and binds ATR - ATRIP , which phosphorylates Chk1 . Mrc1 / Claspin is also required for the complete activation of ATR - ATRIP that phosphorylates Chk1 , the major downstream checkpoint effector kinase . Claspin is a component of the replisome and contains a domain for docking with Chk1 , revealing a specific function of Claspin during DNA replication : the promotion of checkpoint signaling at the replisome .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_47767-48701	Chk1 signaling is vital for arresting the cell cycle and preventing cells from entering mitosis with incomplete DNA replication or DNA damage . The Chk1 - dependent Cdk inhibition is important for the function of the ATR - Chk1 checkpoint and to arrest the cell cycle and allow sufficient time for completion of DNA repair mechanisms , which in turn prevents the inheritance of damaged DNA . In addition , Chk1 - dependent Cdk inhibition plays a critical role in inhibiting origin firing during S phase . This mechanism prevents continued DNA synthesis and is required for the protection of the genome in the presence of replication stress and potential genotoxic conditions . Thus , ATR - Chk1 activity further prevents potential replication problems at the level of single replication origins by inhibiting initiation of replication throughout the genome , until the signaling cascade maintaining cell - cycle arrest is turned off .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_48976-49622	Eukaryotic DNA must be tightly compacted in order to fit within the confined space of the nucleus . Chromosomes are packaged by wrapping 147 nucleotides around an octamer of histone proteins , forming a nucleosome . The nucleosome octamer includes two copies of each histone H2A , H2B , H3 , and H4 . Due to the tight association of histone proteins to DNA , eukaryotic cells have proteins that are designed to remodel histones ahead of the replication fork , in order to allow smooth progression of the replisome . There are also proteins involved in reassembling histones behind the replication fork to reestablish the nucleosome conformation .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_49623-50156	There are several histone chaperones that are known to be involved in nucleosome assembly after replication . The FACT complex has been found to interact with DNA polymerase α - primase complex , and the subunits of the FACT complex interacted genetically with replication factors . The FACT complex is a heterodimer that does not hydrolyze ATP , but is able to facilitate `` loosening '' of histones in nucleosomes , but how the FACT complex is able to relieve the tight association of histones for DNA removal remains unanswered .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_50157-50653	Another histone chaperone that associates with the replisome is Asf1 , which interacts with the Mcm complex dependent on histone dimers H3 - H4 . Asf1 is able to pass newly synthesized H3 - H4 dimer to deposition factors behind the replication fork and this activity makes the H3 - H4 histone dimers available at the site of histone deposition just after replication . Asf1 ( and its partner Rtt109 ) has also been implicated in inhibiting gene expression from replicated genes during S - phase .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_50654-51248	The heterotrimeric chaperone chromatin assembly factor 1 ( CAF - 1 ) is a chromatin formation protein that is involved in depositing histones onto both newly replicated DNA strands to form chromatin . CAF - 1 contains a PCNA - binding motif , called a PIP - box , that allows CAF - 1 to associate with the replisome through PCNA and is able to deposit histone H3 - H4 dimers onto newly synthesized DNA . The Rtt106 chaperone is also involved in this process , and associated with CAF - 1 and H3 - H4 dimers during chromatin formation . These processes load newly synthesized histones onto DNA .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_51249-51879	After the deposition of histones H3 - H4 , nucleosomes form by the association of histone H2A - H2B . This process is thought to occur through the FACT complex , since it already associated with the replisome and is able to bind free H2A - H2B , or there is the possibility of another H2A - H2B chaperone , Nap1 . Electron microscopy studies show that this occurs very quickly , as nucleosomes can be observed forming just a few hundred base pairs after the replication fork . Therefore , the entire process of forming new nucleosomes takes place just after replication due to the coupling of histone chaperones to the replisome .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_51952-52375	When compared to prokaryotic DNA replication , the completion of eukaryotic DNA replication is more complex and involves multiple origins of replication and replicative proteins to accomplish . Prokaryotic DNA is arranged in a circular shape , and has only one replication origin when replication starts . By contrast , eukaryotic DNA is linear . When replicated , there are as many as one thousand origins of replication .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_52376-53327	Eukaryotic DNA is bidirectional . Here the meaning of the word bidirectional is different . Eukaryotic linear DNA has many origins ( called O ) and termini ( called T ) . `` T '' is present to the right of `` O '' . One `` O '' and one `` T '' together form one replicon . After the formation of pre-initiation complex , when one replicon starts elongation , initiation starts in second replicon . Now , if the first replicon moves in clockwise direction , the second replicon moves in anticlockwise direction , until `` T '' of first replicon is reached . At `` T '' , both the replicons merge to complete the process of replication . Meanwhile , the second replicon is moving in forward direction also , to meet with the third replicon . This clockwise and counter-clockwise movement of two replicons is termed as bidirectional replication . On the other hand , in prokaryotes , replication is unidirection ; and occurs only in clockwise direction .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_53328-54325	Eukaryotic DNA replication requires precise coordination of all DNA polymerases and associated proteins to replicate the entire genome each time a cell divides . This process is achieved through a series of steps of protein assemblies at origins of replication , mainly focusing the regulation of DNA replication on the association of the MCM helicase with the DNA . These origins of replication direct the number of protein complexes that will form to initiate replication . In prokaryotic DNA replication regulation focuses on the binding of the DnaA initiator protein to the DNA , with initiation of replication occurring multiple times during one cell cycle . Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA use ATP binding and hydrolysis to direct helicase loading and in both cases the helicase is loaded in the inactive form . However , eukaryotic helicases are double hexamers that are loaded onto double stranded DNA whereas prokaryotic helicases are single hexamers loaded onto single stranded DNA .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_54326-54814	Segregation of chromosomes is another difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells . Rapidly dividing cells , such as bacteria , will often begin to segregate chromosomes that are still in the process of replication . In eukaryotic cells chromosome segregation into the daughter cells is not initiated until replication is complete in all chromosomes . Despite these differences , however , the underlying process of replication is similar for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA .	Eukaryotic DNA replication
829955941_54815-55671	Prokaryotic DNA Replication Eukaryotic DNA replication Occurs inside the cytoplasm Occurs inside the nucleus Only one origin of replication per molecule of DNA Have many origins of replication in each chromosome Origin of replication is about 100 - 200 or more nucleotides in length Each origin of replication is formed of about 150 nucleotides Replication occurs at one point in each chromosome Replication occurs at several points simultaneously in each chromosome Only one replication fork is formed Multiple replication forks are formed simultaneously in each chromosome Only have one origin of replication Has multiple origins of replication Initiation is carried out by protein DnaA and DnaB Initiation is carried out by the Origin Recognition Complex Topoisomerase is needed Topoisomerase is needed Replication is very rapid Replication is very slow	Eukaryotic DNA replication

The Tar Heels won their first NCAA Championship in 1957 under fifth year head coach Frank McGuire , who led an undefeated 32 - 0 squad dominated by Lennie Rosenbluth and several other transplants from the New York City area to a 54 - 53 triple overtime victory over Wilt Chamberlain 's Kansas Jayhawks . C.D. Chesley , a Washington , D.C. television producer , piped the 1957 championship game in Kansas City to a hastily created network of five stations across North Carolina -- the ancestor to the current syndicated ACC football and basketball package from Raycom Sports -- which helped prove pivotal in basketball becoming a craze in the state .

817426327_8151-8554	In 1960 , the Tar Heels were placed on NCAA probation for `` improper recruiting entertainment '' of basketball prospects . As a result , they were barred from the 1961 NCAA tournament and also withdrew from the 1961 ACC Tournament . Following the season , Chancellor William Aycock forced McGuire to resign . As a replacement , Aycock selected one of McGuire 's assistants , Kansas alumnus Dean Smith .	North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball
817426327_8592-9740	Smith 's early teams were not nearly as successful as McGuire 's had been . His first team went only 8 -- 9 , and his first five teams never won more than 16 games . This grated on a fan base used to winning ; in 1965 some of them even hanged him in effigy . However , Smith would go on to take the Tar Heels to a reign of championships and national dominance . When he retired in 1997 , Smith 's 879 wins were the most ever for any NCAA Division I men 's basketball coach , and his 77.6 % winning percentage ninth best . During his tenure , North Carolina won the ACC regular season championship 17 times , the ACC tournament 13 times , and the NIT in 1971 , went to the NCAA tournament 27 times , appeared in 11 Final Fours , and won NCAA national tournament titles in 1982 and 1993 . The 1982 National Championship team was led by James Worthy , Sam Perkins , and a young Michael Jordan . The 1993 National Championship team starred Donald Williams , George Lynch and Eric Montross . While at North Carolina , Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the University 's first African American scholarship basketball player Charlie Scott .

The winner of the coin toss can choose to give the ball or receive the ball . If the first possession results in a field goal , the other team is given possession to match or better the field goal ; therefore continuing the game . If the first possession results in a touchdown or safety , the scoring team wins . During the regular season in the NFL , one overtime period is played ( with each team receiving two time outs ) . If both teams are tied after the 10 - minute overtime , the game officially ends in a tie . In the playoffs , 15 - minute overtime periods continue until a winner is determined . Overtime follows after a three - minute intermission following the end of the regulation game . Prior to start of overtime , a coin flip is performed where the captain of the visiting team calls the toss . The team that wins the coin flip has the option to either receive the kickoff or choose the side of the field they wish to defend . Ties are rare in the NFL ; a game between the Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers on September 16 , 2018 ended in a 29 -- all draw .

809581424_4541-5378	The show is set at a modest waterfront resort at Lake of the Ozarks , inspired by the Alhonna Resort and Marina where series creator Dubuque worked as a dock hand while attending school in Missouri during the 1980s . Most of the shooting locations are in the Atlanta area at Lake Allatoona and Lake Lanier , rather than at the Lake of the Ozarks , because of tax breaks offered by the State of Georgia . The film crew constructed a set in Georgia after extensively studying the Alhonna Resort property . Some scenes are filmed at Chicago locations . Only a few scenes from the pilot were shot in the actual city of Lake Ozark , Missouri , which include shots of the locally famous `` Welcome To Lake Of the Ozarks '' sign and the `` Injun Joe Muffler Man '' statue .

866379367_6324-6973	The origin of this custom is unknown , although many reasons have been given . The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered . This is based on two accounts in the Talmud of rabbis who , upon seeing that their son 's wedding celebration was getting out of hand , broke a vessel -- in the second case a glass -- to calm things down . Another explanation is that it is a reminder that despite the joy , Jews still mourn the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem . Because of this , some recite the verses `` If I forget thee / O Jerusalem ... '' ( Ps. 137 : 5 ) at this point . Many other reasons have been given by traditional authorities .	Jewish wedding

841857706_616-1634	The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a type of organelle found in eukaryotic cells that forms an interconnected network of flattened , membrane - enclosed sacs or tube - like structures known as cisternae . The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane . The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells , but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa . There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum : rough and smooth . The outer ( cytosolic ) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis . The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes . The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism , the production of steroid hormones , and detoxification . The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells . The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 using electron microscopy .	Endoplasmic reticulum
807029274_154-1161	The cell membrane ( also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane , and historically referred to as the plasmalemma ) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment ( the extracellular space ) . It consists of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins . The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings . The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles . In this way , it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules . In addition , cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion , ion conductivity and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures , including the cell wall , the carbohydrate layer called the glycocalyx , and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton . In the field of synthetic biology , cell membranes can be artificially reassembled .	Cell membrane
843512328_946-1805	The Trail of Tears was a series of forced relocations of Native American peoples from their ancestral homelands in the Southeastern United States , to areas to the west ( usually west of the Mississippi River ) that had been designated as Indian Territory . The forced relocations were carried out by government authorities following the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830 . Many of the relocated people suffered from exposure , disease , and starvation while en route to their new designated reserve , and many died before reaching their destinations . The forced removals included members of the Cherokee , Muscogee ( Creek ) , Seminole , Chickasaw , Choctaw , and Ponca nations . The phrase `` Trail of Tears '' originates from a description of the removal of many Native American tribes , including the infamous Cherokee Nation relocation in 1838 .	Trail of Tears
846282869_1580-2418	The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone , brick , tamped earth , wood , and other materials , generally built along an east - to - west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe with an eye to expansion . Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC ; these , later joined together and made bigger and stronger , are collectively referred to as the Great Wall . Especially famous is the wall built in 220 -- 206 BC by Qin Shi Huang , the first Emperor of China . Little of that wall remains . The Great Wall has been rebuilt , maintained , and enhanced over various dynasties ; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 -- 1644 ) .	Great Wall of China
846282869_19534-20837	Before the use of bricks , the Great Wall was mainly built from rammed earth , stones , and wood . During the Ming , however , bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall , as were materials such as tiles , lime , and stone . The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone , so construction quickened . Additionally , bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth . Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick , but is more difficult to use . Consequently , stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation , inner and outer brims , and gateways of the wall . Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall , with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm ( 12 in ) tall , and about 23 cm ( 9.1 in ) wide . From the parapets , guards could survey the surrounding land . Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall , including the ability to call reinforcements and warn garrisons of enemy movements , was of high importance . Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility . Wooden gates could be used as a trap against those going through . Barracks , stables , and armories were built near the wall 's inner surface .	Great Wall of China
825514496_1554-2563	The Pilgrims or Pilgrim Fathers were early European settlers of the Plymouth Colony in present - day Plymouth , Massachusetts , United States . The Pilgrims ' leadership came from the religious congregations of Brownist separatist Puritans who had fled the volatile political environment in England for the relative calm and tolerance of 17th - century Holland in the Netherlands . They held Puritan Calvinist religious beliefs but , unlike other Puritans , they maintained that their congregations needed to be separated from the English state church . They were also concerned that they might lose their English cultural identity if they remained in the Netherlands , so they arranged with English investors to establish a new colony in North America . The colony was established in 1621 and became the second successful English settlement in North America ( after the founding of Jamestown , Virginia in 1607 ) . The Pilgrims ' story became a central theme of the history and culture of the United States .	Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)

852859365_44603-45838	Three months after First Bull Run Union forces suffered another , smaller defeat at the Battle of Ball 's Bluff , near Leesburg , Virginia . The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball 's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War , a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs . Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run , the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell 's army . Although the committee 's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson 's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard , Patterson 's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle , and he was no longer in the service . The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat , and McDowell bore the chief blame . On 25 July 1861 , he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , who would soon be named general - in - chief of all the Union armies . McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. John Pope 's Army of Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia thirteen months later , at the Second Battle of Bull Run .	First Battle of Bull Run

821728509_1916-3363	Subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural Africa , and parts of Asia and Latin America . In 2015 , about 2 billion people ( slightly more than 25 % of the world 's population ) in 500 million households living in rural areas of developing nations survive as `` smallholder '' farmers , working less than 2 hectares ( 5 acres ) of land . Subsistence agriculture had largely disappeared in Europe by the beginning of World War I , and in North America with the movement of sharecroppers and tenant farmers out of the American South and Midwest during the 1930s and 1940s . As recently as the 1950s , it was still common on family farms in North America and Europe to grow much of a family 's own food and make much of its own clothing , although sales of some of the farm 's production earned enough currency to buy certain staples , typically including sugar ; coffee and tea ; petroleum distillates ( petrol , kerosene , fuel oil ) ; textile products such as bolts of cloth , needles , and thread ; medicines ; hardware products such as nails , screws , and wire ; and a few discretionary items such as candy or books . Many of the preceding items , as well as occasional services from physicians , veterinarians , blacksmiths , and others , were often bought with barter rather than currency . In Central and Eastern Europe subsistence and semi-subsistence agriculture reappeared within the transition economy since about 1990 .	Subsistence agriculture
843757803_460-1137	The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite : heat , fuel , and an oxidizing agent ( usually oxygen ) . A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and combined in the right mixture , meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing . A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in the fire triangle . For example , covering a fire with a fire blanket removes the oxygen part of the triangle and can extinguish a fire . In large fires where firefighters are called in , decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area .	Fire triangle

820769473_15895-16818	Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year . Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one - year period can be said to be seasonal . It is common in many situations -- such as grocery store or even in a Medical Examiner 's office -- that the demand depends on the day of the week . In such situations , the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the `` season '' -- seven seasons , one for each day -- which is the ratio of the average demand of that season ( which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season ) to the average demand across all seasons . An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average ; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average .	Forecasting

Russian Blues should not be confused with British Blues ( which are not a distinct breed , but rather a British Shorthair with a blue coat as the British Shorthair breed itself comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns ) , nor the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally occurring breeds of blue cats , although they have similar traits .

803192254_6282-7485	The Baron , his Italian greyhound , Azor ( which he took with him everywhere ) , his young aide de camp Louis de Pontière , his military secretary , Peter Stephen Du Ponceau ( then called Pierre Etienne Du Ponceau ) , and two other companions , reached Portsmouth , New Hampshire on December 1 , 1777 , where they were almost arrested for being British because Steuben had mistakenly outfitted them in red uniforms . They were extravagantly entertained in Boston . On February 5 , 1778 Steuben and his party arrived in York , Pennsylvania , where the Continental Congress had relocated after being ousted from Philadelphia by the British advance . Arrangements were made for Steuben to be paid following the successful completion of the war according to his contributions . He arrived at Valley Forge on February 23 , 1778 , and reported for duty as a volunteer . One soldier 's first impression of the Baron was `` of the ancient fabled God of War ... he seemed to me a perfect personification of Mars . The trappings of his horse , the enormous holsters of his pistols , his large size , and his strikingly martial aspect , all seemed to favor the idea . He turned the volunteers into a great army ''	Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben
844747430_9987-10701	Sound that travels through the outer ear impacts on the eardrum , and causes it to vibrate . The three ossicles bones transmit this sound to a second window ( the oval window ) which protects the fluid - filled inner ear . In detail , the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound , which impacts on the eardrum . The malleus rests on the membrane , and receives the vibration . This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window . Two small muscles , the tensor tympani and stapedius , also help modulate noise . The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations . Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea .	Ear

865337465_9826-11342	Because the prime minister is , in practice , the most politically powerful member of the Canadian government , he or she is sometimes erroneously referred to as Canada 's head of state , when , in fact , that post is held by the Canadian monarch , represented by the governor general . The prime minister is , instead , the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers , which are governed by the constitution and its conventions . However , the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power . Today , as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy , the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding , meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general , leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions . As such , the prime minister , supported by the Office of the Prime Minister ( PMO ) , controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada 's system of governance , including the governor general , the Cabinet , justices of the Supreme Court , senators , heads of crown corporations , ambassadors to foreign countries , the provincial lieutenant governors , and approximately 3,100 other positions . Further , the prime minister plays a prominent role in the legislative process -- with the majority of bills put before parliament originating in the Cabinet -- and the leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces .

830253023_72-590	Parens patriae is Latin for `` parent of the nation '' ( lit. , `` parent of the fatherland '' ) . In law , it refers to the public policy power of the state to intervene against an abusive or negligent parent , legal guardian , or informal caretaker , and to act as the parent of any child or individual who is in need of protection . For example , some children , incapacitated individuals , and disabled individuals lack parents who are able and willing to render adequate care , thus requiring state intervention .	Parens patriae
804966384_609-1422	Dada ( / ˈdɑːdɑː / ) or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant - garde in the early 20th century , with early centers in Zürich , Switzerland at the Cabaret Voltaire ( circa 1916 ) ; New York Dada began circa 1915 , and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris . Developed in reaction to World War I , the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the logic , reason , and aestheticism of modern capitalist society , instead expressing nonsense , irrationality , and anti-bourgeois protest in their works . The art of the movement spanned visual , literary , and sound media , including collage , sound poetry , cut - up writing , and sculpture . Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence , war , and nationalism , and maintained political affinities with the radical left . Cover	Dada

842297443_156-1344	In mathematics , a negative number is a real number that is less than zero . Negative numbers represent opposites . If positive represents a movement to the right , negative represents a movement to the left . If positive represents above sea level , then negative represents below sea level . If positive represents a deposit , negative represents a withdrawal . They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency . A debt that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset , a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase . If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses , then one may choose to distinguish between those senses -- perhaps arbitrarily -- as positive and negative . In the medical context of fighting a tumor , an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage . Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero , such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature . The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic . For example , − ( − 3 ) = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original thing .	Negative number

863614185_34057-35022	By November 1922 , the value in gold of money in circulation had fallen from £ 300 million before World War I to £ 20 million . The Reichsbank responded by the unlimited printing of notes , thereby accelerating the devaluation of the mark . In his report to London , Lord D'Abernon wrote : `` In the whole course of history , no dog has ever run after its own tail with the speed of the Reichsbank . '' Germany went through its worst inflation in 1923 . In 1922 , the highest denomination was 50,000 Marks . By 1923 , the highest denomination was 100,000,000,000,000 ( 10 ) Marks . In December 1923 the exchange rate was 4,200,000,000,000 ( 4.2 × 10 ) Marks to 1 US dollar . In 1923 , the rate of inflation hit 3.25 × 10 percent per month ( prices double every two days ) . Beginning on 20 November 1923 , 1,000,000,000,000 old Marks were exchanged for 1 Rentenmark , so that 4.2 Rentenmarks were worth 1 US dollar , exactly the same rate the Mark had in 1914 .

Standing 4,207 m ( 13,802 ft ) above sea level , its peak is the highest point in the state of Hawaii . Much of the mountain is under water ; when measured from its oceanic base , Mauna Kea is over 10,000 m ( 33,000 ft ) tall and is the tallest mountain on Earth . Mauna Kea is about a million years old , and has thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago . In its current post-shield state , its lava is more viscous , resulting in a steeper profile . Late volcanism has also given it a much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes ; contributing factors include the construction of cinder cones , the decentralization of its rift zones , the glaciation on its peak , and the weathering effects of the prevailing trade winds . Mauna Kea last erupted 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and is now considered dormant .	Mauna Kea

846590504_5996-6990	Insulin ( from Latin insula , island ) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets ; it is considered to be the main anabolic hormone of the body . It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat .	Insulin

843862354_838-1497	Sanctification is the act or process of acquiring sanctity , of being made or becoming holy . It is a gift given through the power of God to a person or thing which is then considered sacred or set apart in an official capacity within the religion . In general anything from a temple , to vessels , to days of the week , to a human believer who willingly accepts this gift can be sanctified . To sanctify is to literally `` set apart for particular use in a special purpose or work and to make holy or sacred . '' Etymologically , `` sanctify '' derives from the Latin verb sanctificare which in turn derives from sanctus `` holy '' and facere `` to make '' .	Sanctification

842629338_2085-3555	The process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells . The first being a female gamete , known as the ovum ( egg / oocyte ) . In human SCNT ( Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer ) experiments , these eggs are obtained through consenting donors , utilizing ovarian stimulation . The second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body . Skin cells , fat cells , and liver cells are only a few examples . The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded , leaving it ' deprogrammed . ' What is left is a somatic cell and an denucleated egg cell . These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the ' empty ' ovum . After being inserted into the egg , the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell . The ovum , now containing the somatic cell 's nucleus , is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide . The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent . Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions , this single cell forms a blastocyst ( an early stage embryo with about 100 cells ) with an identical genome to the original organism ( i.e. a clone ) . Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term .

836776689_626-1452	Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life . During this phase , the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis . Interphase is the ' daily living ' or metabolic phase of the cell , in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them , grows , reads its DNA , and conducts other `` normal '' cell functions . The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase . This phase was formerly called the resting phase . However , interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting ; rather , the cell is living , and preparing for later cell division , so the name was changed . A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis . However , since mitosis is the division of the nucleus , prophase is actually the first stage .	Interphase

At the same time , other novel institutions -- the asylum and the almshouse -- redefined care for the mentally ill and the poor . For its proponents , the penitentiary was an ambitious program whose external appearance , internal arrangements , and daily routine would counteract the disorder and immorality thought to be breeding crime in American society . Although its adoption was haphazard at first , and marked by political strife -- especially in the South -- the penitentiary became an established institution in the United States by the end of the 1830s .

The diversity of fynbos plants is extremely high , with over 9000 species of plants occurring in the area , around 6200 of which are endemic , i.e. growing nowhere else in the world . South Africa 's Western Cape has a level of botanic diversity that exceeds that of the richest tropical rainforest in South America , including the Amazon . Of the Ericas , over 600 occur in the fynbos kingdom , while only two or three dozen have been described in the rest of the world .

This first temple is believed to have been completed by 607 . Hōryū - ji was dedicated to Yakushi Nyorai , the Buddha of healing and in honor of the prince 's father . Excavations done in 1939 confirmed that Prince Shotoku 's palace , the Ikaruga - no - miya ( 斑鳩 宮 ) , occupied the eastern part of the current temple complex , where the Tō - in ( 東院 ) sits today . Also discovered were the ruins of a temple complex which was southwest of the prince 's palace and not completely within the present temple complex . The original temple , named by modern historians and archaeologists Wakakusa - garan ( 若草 伽藍 ) , was lost , probably burned to the ground after being hit by lightning in 670 . The temple was reconstructed but slightly reoriented in a northwest position , which is believed to have been completed by around 711 .

855310564_3255-3884	Temperature is a monotonic function of the average molecular kinetic energy of a substance . When a substance is heated , the kinetic energy of its molecules increases . Thus , the molecules begin vibrating / moving more and usually maintain a greater average separation . Materials which contract with increasing temperature are unusual ; this effect is limited in size , and only occurs within limited temperature ranges ( see examples below ) . The relative expansion ( also called strain ) divided by the change in temperature is called the material 's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature .	Thermal expansion
850115943_36-847	The mass number ( symbol A , from the German word Atomgewichte ( atomic weight ) , also called atomic mass number or nucleon number , is the total number of protons and neutrons ( together known as nucleons ) in an atomic nucleus . It determines the atomic mass of atoms . Because protons and neutrons both are baryons , the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion . The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element . This is not the same as the atomic number ( Z ) which denotes the number of protons in a nucleus , and thus uniquely identifies an element . Hence , the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( N ) in a given nucleus : N = A − Z ( \ displaystyle N = A-Z ) .	Mass number

854671021_9433-10149	Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income . Unlike the median household income , which divides all households in two halves , the mean income is the average income earned by American households . In the case of mean income , the income of all households is divided by the number of all households . The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top . As a result , the mean tends to be higher than the median income , with the top earning households boosting it . Overall , the mean household income in the United States , according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement , was $72,641 .	Household income in the United States

This helps us analyze potentially ambiguous messages and decipher them correctly . It can also affect our perception of unknown sounds based on the noise in the environment . For example , we may fill in a word we can not make out in a sentence based on the other words we could understand .

831525079_2310-2803	Beam bridges are often only used for relatively short distances because , unlike truss bridges , they have no built in supports . The only supports are provided by piers . The farther apart its supports , the weaker a beam bridge gets . As a result , beam bridges rarely span more than 250 feet ( 80 m ) . This does n't mean beam bridges are n't used to cross great distances , it only means that a series of beam bridges must be joined together , creating what 's known as a continuous span .	Beam bridge

795331768_28530-29734	After the Gallipoli Campaign , Australian troops returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion , which involved the raising of another three infantry divisions -- the 3rd , 4th and 5th -- and the establishment of the Anzac Mounted Division . In March 1916 , the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units stayed in the area and fought Turkish troops and the Senussi Arab tribes that were threatening British control of Egypt . Mounted troops were particularly important in the defence of Egypt and Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the campaign , first seeing combat in the Battle of Romani . Apart from the horsemen , the mounted troops included the 1st Imperial Camel Corps Brigade . This was organised as a mounted infantry brigade . Of its four battalions , the 1st and 3rd were composed of Australians , the 2nd was British , and the 4th was half Australian and half New Zealand . The cameliers participated in most of the fighting in Egypt and Palestine until the brigade was disbanded in July 1918 . The Australian and New Zealand components then traded their camels for horses and became the 5th Light Horse Brigade .	Military history of Australia during World War I
832918339_3291-4562	According to Ban Gu , writing in the Book of Han , the Analects originated as individual records kept by Confucius 's disciples of conversations between the Master and them , which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius 's death in 479 BC . The work is therefore titled Lunyu meaning `` edited conversations '' or `` selected speeches '' ( i.e. analects ) . This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars , for example the Song dynasty neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stated that Analects is the records of Confucius 's first - and second - generation pupils . The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty philologist Cui Shu ( 崔 述 , 1740 -- 1816 ) who argued on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work . Many modern scholars now believe that the work was compiled over a period of around two hundred years , with some questioning the authenticity of some of the sayings . Because no texts of the Analects have been discovered earlier , and because the Analects was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty , some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text 's compilation .

835987187_488-1482	Cobalt - 60 , Co , is a synthetic radioactive isotope of cobalt with a half - life of 5.2714 years . It is produced artificially in nuclear reactors . Deliberate industrial production depends on neutron activation of bulk samples of the monoisotopic and mononuclidic cobalt isotope Co . Measurable quantities are also produced as a by - product of typical nuclear power plant operation and may be detected externally when leaks occur . In the latter case ( in the absence of added cobalt ) the incidentally produced Co is largely the result of multiple stages of neutron activation of iron isotopes in the reactor 's steel structures via the creation of Co precursor . The simplest case of the latter would result from the activation of Fe . Co decays by beta decay to the stable isotope nickel - 60 ( Ni ) . The activated nickel nucleus emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV , hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is Co + n → Co → Ni + e + ν + gamma rays .	Cobalt-60
850931827_11086-12414	C. porcellus is not found naturally in the wild ; it is likely descended from closely related species of cavies , such as C. aperea , C. fulgida , and C. tschudii , which are still commonly found in various regions of South America . Studies from 2007 -- 2010 applied molecular markers and studied the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals , thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be Cavia tschudii . Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ) , when it is harder for predators to spot them .	Guinea pig
841515068_1021-1655	The origin of the term itself has been largely attributed to American author Stephen Crane , who added the phrase , in 1896 , to the second edition of his short novel , Maggie : A Girl of the Streets . Crane writes , `` I knew this was the way it would be . They got cold feet . '' The term is present in `` Seed Time and Harvest '' by Fritz Reuter published in 1862 . Kenneth McKenzie , a former professor of Italian at Princeton University attributed the first use of the phrase to the play Volpone produced by Ben Jonson in 1605 . The true origin and first usage of the phrase remains debated and unconfirmed as exemplified above .	Cold feet

848649628_929-1973	Western governments first considered the idea of boycotting the Moscow Olympics in response to the situation in Afghanistan at the 20 December 1979 meeting of NATO representatives , a fortnight after the invasion of Afghanistan . The idea was not completely new : since 1975 / 1976 proposals for an Olympic boycott circulated widely among human rights activists and groups as a sanction for Soviet violations of human rights . At that moment , not many of the member governments were interested in the proposal . The idea began to gain popularity in early January 1980 when Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov called for a boycott . On 14 January 1980 , the Carter Administration joined Sakharov 's appeal and set a deadline by which the Soviet Union must pull out of Afghanistan or face the consequences , including an international boycott of the games . On 26 January 1980 , Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark announced that Canada , like the US , would boycott the Olympic Games if Soviet forces did not leave Afghanistan by 20 February 1980 .	1980 Summer Olympics boycott
840973836_283-1254	Wernicke 's area ( / ˈvɛərnɪkə / or / ˈvɛərnɪki / ; German : ( ˈvɛʁnɪkə ) ) , also called Wernicke 's speech area , is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex that are linked to speech ( the other is Broca 's area ) . It is involved in the comprehension or understanding of written and spoken language ( in contrast to Broca 's area that is involved in the production of language ) . It is traditionally thought to be in Brodmann area 22 , which is located in the superior temporal lobe in the dominant cerebral hemisphere ( which is the left hemisphere in about 95 % of right handed individuals and 60 % of left handed individuals ) . Damage caused to Wernicke 's area results in receptive , fluent aphasia . This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words , but the phrases will lack meaning . This is unlike non-fluent aphasia , in which the person will use meaningful words , but in a non-fluent , telegraphic manner .	Wernicke's area
803493063_4363-5677	Snow in North Carolina is seen on a regular basis in the mountains . North Carolina averages 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of snow a year . However , this also varies greatly across the state . Along the coast , most areas register less than 2 inches ( 51 mm ) per year while the state capital , Raleigh averages 7.5 inches ( 190 mm ) . Farther west in the Piedmont - Triad , the average grows to approximately 9 inches ( 230 mm ) . The Charlotte area averages approximately 6.5 inches ( 170 mm ) . The mountains in the west act as a barrier , preventing most snowstorms from entering the Piedmont . When snow does make it past the mountains , it is usually light and is seldom on the ground for more than two or three days . However , several storms have dropped 18 inches ( 460 mm ) or more of snow within normally warm areas . The 1993 Storm of the Century that lasted from March 11 to March 15 affected locales from Canada to Central America , and brought a significant amount of snow to North Carolina . Newfound Gap received more than 36 inches ( 0.91 m ) of snow with drifts more than 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) , while Mount Mitchell measured over 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) of snow with drifts to 14 feet ( 4.3 m ) . Most of the northwestern part of the state received somewhere between 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) an 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) of snow .	Climate of North Carolina

805590384_798-1612	The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter , but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter . Also , the term phase is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram . Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter , such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another , this latter usage is similar to the use of `` phase '' as a synonym for state of matter . However , the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not commensurate with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used .

852484941_4164-5668	The history of pre-Celtic Europe and the exact relationship between ethnic , linguistic and cultural factors in the Celtic world remains uncertain and controversial . The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is disputed ; in particular , the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts have become a subject of controversy . According to one theory , the common root of the Celtic languages , the Proto - Celtic language , arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe , which flourished from around 1200 BC . According to a theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Europe ( c. 800 -- 450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . Thus this area is sometimes called the `` Celtic homeland '' . By or during the later La Tène period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey .

814023619_807-2106	Jekyll and Hyde tells the story of a doctor , Jekyll , who , trying to find the basis of good and evil , develops an evil alter ego , Hyde . The song is sung by the two female leads , Lucy and Emma . Emma , Jekyll 's fiancé , is a refined young woman who is reluctant to support her husband 's experiments fearing that he is becoming too involved in the process . Lucy is a prostitute at a gentlemen 's club who becomes infatuated with the Hyde persona , eventually resulting in her death . While the two characters are very different , they both love the same man , albeit different personas within the same physicality . In this song , they lament about their separate desires for Jekyll / Hyde to see how much they love him and how their lives have been altered by the man and his experiments . Both women dream about their futures , with or without Jekyll / Hyde . They both , separately , come to the realization that their love for him is much too strong to ever truly break away . In mutual agreement , they recognize that when they look into the eyes of the man they love , they are filled with everything they need to continue on . The song ends with them fully believing that the love they have for Jekyll / Hyde enriches their lives and are committed to doing whatever they can for him .	In His Eyes
835214350_3577-4639	The Union and Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years . The Union finally won the war when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the Battle of Appomattox Court House , followed by a series of surrenders by Confederate generals throughout the southern states . Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 people dead , more than the number of U.S. military deaths in all other wars combined ( at least until approximately the Vietnam War ) . Much of the South 's infrastructure was destroyed , especially the transportation systems , railroads , mills , and houses . The Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and 4 million slaves were freed . The Reconstruction Era ( 1863 -- 1877 ) overlapped and followed the war , with the process of restoring national unity , strengthening the national government , and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country .

817828232_4846-6369	Frank was a prolific author , writing 40 books . He published widely on political economy , economic history , international relations , historical sociology , and world history . Perhaps his most notable work is Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America . Published in 1967 , it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory . In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient : Global Economy in the Asian Age and , with Barry Gills , The World System : Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand . Frank 's theories center on the idea that a nation 's economic strength , largely determined by historical circumstances -- especially geography -- dictates its global power . He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries . Frank has made significant contributions to the world - systems theory ( which , according to him , should be rather called the World System one ) . He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC ; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the `` long 16th century '' ( a position held , for example , by Immanuel Wallerstein ) . Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous `` world - systems '' did not make much sense ( indeed , if there are many `` world - systems '' in the world , then they simply do not deserve to be called `` world - systems '' ) , and we should rather speak about one single World System .

808402520_46330-47020	In the 1830s German scholars of the Tübingen school tried to date the books as late as the 3rd century , but the discovery of some New Testament manuscripts and fragments from the 2nd and 3rd centuries , one of which dates as early as 125 ( Papyrus 52 ) , disproves a 3rd - century date of composition for any book now in the New Testament . Additionally , a letter to the church at Corinth in the name of Clement of Rome in 95 quotes from 10 of the 27 books of the New Testament , and a letter to the church at Philippi in the name of Polycarp in 120 quotes from 16 books . Therefore , some of the books of the New Testament must have been in circulation by the end of the first century .	New Testament

800332980_257-1955	The United States embargo against Cuba ( in Cuba called el bloqueo , `` the blockade '' ) is a commercial , economic , and financial embargo imposed by the United States on Cuba . An embargo was first imposed by the United States on sale of arms to Cuba on March 14 , 1958 , during the Fulgencio Batista regime . Again on October 19 , 1960 ( almost two years after the Batista regime was deposed by the Cuban Revolution ) the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine after Cuba nationalized American - owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation . On February 7 , 1962 the embargo was extended to include almost all imports . Currently , the Cuban embargo is enforced mainly through six statutes : the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 , the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 , the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963 , the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 , the Helms -- Burton Act of 1996 , and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 . The stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to maintain sanctions on Cuba as long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward `` democratization and greater respect for human rights '' . The Helms -- Burton Act further restricted United States citizens from doing business in or with Cuba , and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in Havana unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met . In 1999 , President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba . In 2000 , Clinton authorized the sale of `` humanitarian '' U.S. products to Cuba .	United States embargo against Cuba
798130155_4462-5096	Juries in criminal cases are generally , as a rule , required to reach a unanimous verdict , and juries in civil cases typically have to reach a majority on some level . If a defendant has been found guilty of a capital offense , one that could result in the death penalty if the person is eligible , the opinion of the jury must be unanimous if the defendant is to be sentenced to death . Currently , two states , Oregon and Louisiana , do not require unanimous verdicts in criminal cases . Each requires a 10 - 2 majority for conviction , except for capital crimes : Oregon requires at least 11 votes and Louisiana requires all 12 .	Hung jury
826060451_1705-2543	A likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the `` dead horse '' ritual of seamen ( see Beating a dead horse ) . In this practice , the seaman paraded a straw - stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard . Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage , and they frequently spent their pay all at once , resulting in a period of time without income . If they got advances from the ship 's paymaster , they would incur debt . This period was called the `` dead horse '' time , and it usually lasted a month or two . The seaman 's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the `` dead horse '' debt . As west - bound shipping from Europe usually reached the subtropics at about the time the `` dead horse '' was worked off , the latitude became associated with the ceremony .	Horse latitudes

827393090_3008-3579	The main purpose of a myelin sheath is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber . Along unmyelinated fibers , impulses continuously move as waves , but , in myelinated fibers , they `` hop '' or propagate by saltatory conduction . Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane ( the axolemma ) . Thus , myelination prevents the electric current from leaving the axon . It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body parts .	Myelin

816023985_261-1218	The Minié ball , or Minni ball , is a type of muzzle - loading spin - stabilized rifle bullet named after its co-developer , Claude - Étienne Minié , inventor of the Minié rifle . It came to prominence in the Crimean War and American Civil War . The development of the Minié ball was significant because it was the first projectile which was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun . Rifling -- the addition of spiral grooves inside the gun barrel , which imparted a spin to the bullet -- greatly increased the range and accuracy of the gun . Prior to the Minié ball , bullets had to be jammed down the rifle barrel , sometimes with a mallet , and after a relatively small number of shots , gunpowder residue built up in the spiral grooves , which then had to be cleaned out . Both the American Springfield and the British Enfield rifles -- the most common rifles used during the American Civil War -- used the Minié ball .	Minié ball
853463492_4180-4948	Historians differ on the origin of the horseshoe . Because iron was a valuable commodity , and any worn out items were generally reforged and reused , it is difficult to locate clear archaeological evidence . Although some credit the Druids , there is no hard evidence to support this claim . In 1897 four bronze horseshoes with what are apparently nail holes were found in an Etruscan tomb dated around 400 B.C. The assertion by some historians that the Romans invented the `` mule shoes '' sometime after 100 BC is supported by a reference by Catullus who died in 54 BC . However , these references to use of horseshoes and muleshoes in Rome , may have been to the `` hipposandal '' -- leather boots , reinforced by an iron plate , rather than to nailed horseshoes .

803302492_842-1710	London Bridge is a bridge in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . It was built in the 1830s and formerly spanned the River Thames in London , England . It was dismantled in 1967 and relocated to Arizona . The Arizona bridge is a reinforced concrete structure clad in the original masonry of the 1830s bridge , which was purchased by Robert P. McCulloch from the City of London . McCulloch had exterior granite blocks from the original bridge numbered and transported to America to construct the present bridge in Lake Havasu City , a planned community he established in 1964 on the shore of Lake Havasu . The bridge was completed in 1971 ( along with a canal ) , and links an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City . The song `` London Bridge is Falling Down '' is a nursery rhyme that predates the bridge 's original 19th - century construction .	London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)

An observer who only sees the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most , or even all , of the tree 's fruit is in a likewise good condition . This can also give a false impression of the quality of the fruit ( since it is only a sample and is not a representative sample ) .	Cherry picking
801052337_13783-14636	On January 1 , 2009 , 70 years since the death of his creator , Segar 's character of Popeye ( though not the various films , TV shows , theme music and other media based on him ) became public domain in most countries , but remains under copyright in the United States .

837276776_333-950	The ancient Greek drama was a theatrical culture that flourished in ancient Greece from c. 700 BC . The city - state of Athens , which became a significant cultural , political , and military power during this period , was its center , where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia , which honoured the god Dionysus . Tragedy ( late 500 BC ) , comedy ( 490 BC ) , and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there . Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote a common cultural identity . Only men were allowed to play female parts .	Theatre of ancient Greece

799544102_2379-3528	The lyrics have the singer daydreaming for a girl to love , singing that he waits `` between shows '' for his lover . Young has claimed that he wrote the song `` for a city girl on peeling pavement coming at me through Phil Ochs ' eyes playing finger cymbals . It was hard to explain to my wife . '' The city girl playing finger cymbals is a reference to folk singer Jean Ray . Music critic Johnny Rogan described the lyrics as `` exotic and allusive without really saying anything at all . '' Critic Toby Creswell describes the lyrics as `` cryptic love lyrics '' noting that they are sung `` over the crunching power of Crazy Horse . '' Critic John Mendelsohn felt the song conveyed a message of `` desperation begetting brutal vindictiveness , '' hinted at by the `` almost impenetrably subjective words '' but carried strongly by the sound of Crazy Horse 's `` heavy , sinister accompaniment . '' Introducing the song at a performance associated with Writer 's Week at Whittier College ( California ) in April , 2015 , Los Lobos co-founder Louie Perez said that when he first heard `` Cinnamon Girl '' , he was sure it was about a Mexican girl .

822116215_7848-8999	The first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire ( Byzantine Empire ) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I , who was infected but survived through extensive treatment . The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million ( 6th century outbreak ) to 50 million people ( two centuries of recurrence ) . The historian Procopius wrote , in Volume II of History of the Wars , of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire . In the spring of 542 , the plague arrived in Constantinople , working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea , later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy . Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinian 's efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies , his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague . Procopius , in his work Secret History , declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness .	Bubonic plague
806557369_3329-4459	The Vulgaria draws from a variety of sources , for example including the saying `` It does no good for all truth to be told nor all wrong imputed '' derived from the Old English Durham Proverbs .

828105367_1441-2207	Accounting rate of return , also known as the Average rate of return , or ARR is a financial ratio used in capital budgeting . The ratio does not take into account the concept of time value of money . ARR calculates the return , generated from net income of the proposed capital investment . The ARR is a percentage return . Say , if ARR = 7 % , then it means that the project is expected to earn seven cents out of each dollar invested ( yearly ) . If the ARR is equal to or greater than the required rate of return , the project is acceptable . If it is less than the desired rate , it should be rejected . When comparing investments , the higher the ARR , the more attractive the investment . More than half of large firms calculate ARR when appraising projects .	Accounting rate of return
854641588_6761-7874	The origin of the person of Jonas Bronck ( c. 1600 -- 43 ) is contested . Some sources claim he was a Swedish born emigrant from Komstad , Norra Ljunga parish in Småland , Sweden , who arrived in New Netherland during the spring of 1639 . Bronck became the first recorded European settler in the area now known as the Bronx and built a farm named `` Emmanus '' close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in Mott Haven . He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem ( on Manhattan Island ) , and bought additional tracts from the local tribes . He eventually accumulated 500 acres ( 200 ha ) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung , which became known as Bronck 's River or the Bronx ( River ) . Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck 's Land . The American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck , either Jonas Bronck 's son or his younger brother . More recent research indicates that Pieter was probably Jonas ' nephew or cousin , but certainly of the same family .	The Bronx

803762618_626-1311	`` You 're So Vain '' is a song written and performed by Carly Simon and released in November 1972 . The song is a critical profile of a self - absorbed lover about whom Simon asserts `` You 're so vain , you probably think this song is about you . '' The title subject 's identity has long been a matter of speculation , with Simon stating that the song refers to three men , only one of whom she has named publicly , actor Warren Beatty . The song is ranked at # 82 on Billboard 's Greatest Songs of All - Time . `` You 're So Vain '' was voted # 216 in RIAA 's Songs of the Century , and in August 2014 , the UK 's Official Charts Company crowned it the ultimate song of the 1970s .

864500956_8184-8866	The standard title for monarchs from Æthelstan until John was Rex Anglorum ( `` King of the English '' ) . Canute the Great , a Dane , was the first to call himself `` King of England '' . In the Norman period Rex Anglorum remained standard , with occasional use of Rex Anglie ( `` King of England '' ) . From John 's reign onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of Rex or Regina Anglie . In 1604 James I , who had inherited the English throne the previous year , adopted the title ( now usually rendered in English rather than Latin ) King of Great Britain . The English and Scottish parliaments , however , did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707 .	Kingdom of England
833310116_870-1555	The song is believed to have been composed by slaves in the first half of the 19th century . Some references suggest that it was copyrighted by Jay Roberts in 1865 , . In 1882 , the song was published in Jubilee Songs by M.G. Slayton and in A Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies by Marshall W. Taylor . The first recorded version was by Harrod 's Jubilee Singers , on Paramount Records No. 12116 in 1922 ( though some sources suggest 1924 ) .

843537822_3963-5068	The Berlin Wall ( German : Berliner Mauer , pronounced ( bɛʁˈliːnɐ ˈmaʊ̯ɐ ) ( listen ) ) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989 . Constructed by the German Democratic Republic ( GDR , East Germany ) , starting on 13 August 1961 , the Wall cut off ( by land ) West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989 . Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992 . The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the `` death strip '' ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , `` fakir beds '' and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the `` will of the people '' in building a socialist state in East Germany . In practice , the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that had marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period .	Berlin Wall
845699215_8872-10022	The song takes influences from the hip hop genre and contains a large array of musical instruments . The song begins with a sparse , isolated sounding piano melody that drones on during the start of the song . After about a minute and a half , West provides his first verse . West sings `` you 've been putting up with my shit just way too long , '' before launching into the ironic chorus of `` let 's have a toast for the douchebags '' . A vocal sample of `` Look at you ! Look at you ! '' is also heard throughout the song at seemingly random points , excerpted from Rick James ' 1981 live performance in Long Beach , California . West begs his girlfriend to `` run away '' from his destructive behavior , warning her of further behavior , while also dwelling on his own intimacy issues . The piano chord that introduces the song continues on , but the production then introduces a forceful cello and a light string section . The second verse is delivered by Pusha T who is used as a juxtaposition against West ; where West is heartfelt and sincere towards his girlfriend the song , Pusha T is rude towards his and also glorifies cocaine dealing .

863646880_6992-7938	Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago . Lunar calendars were among the first to appear , either 12 or 13 lunar months ( either 354 or 384 days ) . Without intercalation to add days or months to some years , seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months . Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year ( now known to be about 365.24 days ) and a year of just twelve lunar months . The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures , at least partly due to this relationship of months to years . Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica , particularly in ancient Mayan civilization . These calendars were religiously and astronomically based , with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month , plus five epagomenal days at the end of the year .	Time
824739779_2524-3340	India is the second largest producer of fibre in the world and the major fibre produced is cotton . Other fibres produced in India include silk , jute , wool , and man - made fibers . 60 % of the Indian textile Industry is cotton based . The strong domestic demand and the revival of the Economic markets by 2009 has led to huge growth of the Indian textile industry . In December 2010 , the domestic cotton price was up by 50 % as compared to the December 2009 prices . The causes behind high cotton price are due to the floods in Pakistan and China . India projected a high production of textile ( 325 lakh bales for 2010 - 11 ) . There has been increase in India 's share of global textile trading to seven percent in five years . The rising prices are the major concern of the domestic producers of the country .	Textile industry in India

852350752_9229-10513	Lyrically , `` Diamonds '' is a departure from Rihanna 's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs , and contains a prominent concept of love . The first verse introduces the song 's concept : `` Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I , you and I / We 're like diamonds in the sky . '' The hook continues this metaphor : `` So shine bright , tonight , you and I / We 're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye , so alive . '' According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe , the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as `` I choose to be happy '' and `` We 're like diamonds in the sky '' . James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship , particularly with the line `` When you hold me , I 'm alive '' , and admits `` I knew that we 'd become one right away '' . Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as , `` When you hold me , I 'm alive , '' and `` At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes . '' The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna 's private life .	Diamonds (Rihanna song)
831159900_3007-3739	The Gospel of Mark was written anonymously . Early Christian tradition ascribes it to John Mark , a companion and interpreter of the apostle Peter . Hence its author is often called Mark , even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown . It was probably written c . AD 66 -- 70 , during Nero 's persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt , as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution . The author used a variety of pre-existing sources , such as conflict stories ( Mark 2 : 1 -- 3 : 6 ) , apocalyptic discourse ( 4 : 1 -- 35 ) , and collections of sayings ( although not the Gospel of Thomas and probably not the Q source ) .

821215688_601-1146	In organic chemistry , a hydrate is a compound formed by the addition of water or its elements to another molecule . For example : ethanol , CH -- CH -- OH , is the product of the hydration reaction of ethene , CH = CH , formed by the addition of H to one C and OH to the other C , and so can be considered as the hydrate of ethene . A molecule of water may be eliminated , for example by the action of sulfuric acid . Another example is chloral hydrate , CCl -- CH ( OH ) , which can be formed by reaction of water with chloral , CCl -- CH =O .	Hydrate
801810664_2581-3440	The name Macedonia derives from the Greek Μακεδονία ( Makedonía ) , a kingdom ( later , region ) named after the ancient Macedonians . Their name , Μακεδόνες ( Makedónes ) , is cognate to the Ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός ( makednós ) , meaning `` tall , slim '' . It was traditionally derived from the Indo - European root * mak - , meaning ' long ' or ' slender ' ( attested in Homer , and recorded by Hesychius of Alexandria as a Doric word meaning `` large '' ) , or makros ( ' long , large ' ) , as well as related words in other Indo - European languages . It is commonly explained as having originally meant ' the tall ones ' or ' highlanders ' . However , according to modern research by Robert S.P. Beekes , both terms are of Pre-Greek substrate origin and can not be explained in terms of Indo - European morphology .	Macedonia (terminology)

He describes her as wonderfully beautiful : `` The all - seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun . '' Rosaline , however , chooses to remain chaste ; Romeo says : `` She hath forsworn to love , and in that vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now . '' This is the source of his depression , and he makes his friends unhappy ; Mercutio comments : `` That same pale , hard - hearted wench , that Rosaline , torments him so that he will sure run mad . '' Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where , he claims , Rosaline will look like `` a crow '' alongside the other beautiful women . Romeo agrees , but doubts Benvolio 's assessment . After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change : `` Did my heart love till now ? Forswear it , sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night . '' Because their relationship is sudden and secret , Romeo 's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play .	Rosaline

The first actor to be assigned to The Lion King , Broderick learned of the role while he was on vacation in Ireland , where he received a telephone call from his agent informing him that the directors were interested in casting him as Simba . At the time , Broderick was well known for portraying the title character in Ferris Bueller 's Day Off ( 1986 ) . The directors decided to cast him as Simba because they felt that he was `` perfect '' for the role ; according to producer Don Hahn , Broderick 's voice resembled `` the kind of character who could be irresponsible and likeable , but you also felt that he could come back in a very heroic way . '' Jonathan Taylor Thomas , who was starring as Randy Taylor on the television sitcom Home Improvement at the time , was cast as the speaking voice of Young Simba . His appearance and personality would later serve as creative inspiration for supervising animator Mark Henn .	Simba

856681038_6587-7424	The provincial state of Bengal had an area of 490,000 km ( 189,000 mi ) and a population of nearly 78.5 million . It comprised West Bengal with a Hindu majority and East Bengal and Assam with a Muslim majority . It included the Hindi - speaking regions of Bihar , the Odia - speaking regions of Odisha as well as the Assamese - speaking region of Assam , making it a huge administrative entity . Moreover , the capital , Calcutta , was also the capital of the entire British India . With the growing efforts of the Indian freedom fighters to secure the independence of India , Lord Curzon decided to address both these problems by partitioning Bengal into two entities , which would result in a Muslim - majority in the eastern half , and a Hindu - majority in the western half . This he hoped would reduce the administrative pressures .	Partition of Bengal (1905)
854251068_2944-3937	According to the American Journal of Psychiatry , sadness has been found to be associated with `` increases in bilateral activity within the vicinity of the middle and posterior temporal cortex , lateral cerebellum , cerebellar vermis , midbrain , putamen , and caudate . '' Jose V. Pardo has his M.D and Ph. D and leads a research program in cognitive neuroscience . Using positron emission tomography ( PET ) Pardo and his colleagues were able to provoke sadness among seven normal men and women by asking them to think about sad things . They observed increased brain activity in the bilateral inferior and orbitofrontal cortex . In a study that induced sadness in subjects by showing emotional film clips , the feeling was correlated with significant increases in regional brain activity , especially in the prefrontal cortex , in the region called Brodmann 's area 9 , and the thalamus . A significant increase in activity was also observed in the bilateral anterior temporal structures .	Sadness
840297813_3670-5180	It is difficult to assess Shakespeare 's reputation in his own lifetime and shortly after . England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays . Some of Shakespeare 's plays , particularly the history plays , were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto ( i.e. pamphlet ) form ; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition .

798459672_9732-10517	The park 's oldest rocks , Pinto gneiss among them , are 1.7 billion years old . They are exposed in places on the park 's surface in the Cottonwood , Pinto , and Eagle mountains . Much later , from 250 to 75 million years ago , tectonic plate movements forced volcanic material toward the surface at this location and formed granites , including monzogranite common to the Wonderland of Rocks , parts of the Pinto , Eagle , and Coxcomb mountains , and elsewhere . Erosion eventually exposed the harder rocks , gneiss and granite , in the uplands and reduced the softer rocks to debris that filled the canyons and basins between the ranges . The debris , moved by gravity and water , formed alluvial fans at the mouths of canyons as well as bajadas where the alluvial fans overlapped .	Joshua Tree National Park
838717592_1497-2466	President Andrew Johnson commissioned Oliver Kelley to go to the Southern states and to collect data to improve Southern agricultural conditions . In the South , poor farmers bore the brunt of the Civil War and were suspicious of Northerners like Kelley . Kelley found he was able to overcome these sectional differences as a Mason . With Southern Masons as guides , he toured the war - torn countryside in the South and was appalled by the outdated farming practices . He saw the need for an organization that would bring people from the North and South together in a spirit of mutual cooperation and , after many letters and consultations with the other founders , the Grange was born . The first Grange , Grange # 1 , was founded in 1868 in Fredonia , New York . Seven men and one woman co-founded the Grange : Oliver Hudson Kelley , William Saunders , Francis M.

800075295_2911-4116	Beth McCarthy - Miller , then an executive with MTV , says the duo 's poor English language skills , when they came in for their first interview with the channel , stirred doubts among those present as to whether they had sung on their records . The first public sign that the group was lip - synching came on 21 July 1989 , during a live performance on MTV at the Lake Compounce theme park in Bristol , Connecticut . As they performed , the recording of the song `` Girl You Know It 's True '' jammed and began to skip , repeating the partial line `` Girl , you know it 's ... '' over and over through the speakers . They continued to pretend to sing and dance onstage for a few more moments , then they both ran offstage . According to the episode of VH1 's Behind the Music which profiled Milli Vanilli , Downtown Julie Brown stated that fans attending the concert seemed neither to care , nor even to notice , and the concert continued as if nothing unusual had happened . In a March 1990 issue of Time magazine , Pilatus was quoted proclaiming himself to be `` the new Elvis '' , reasoning that by the duo 's success they were more talented musically than Bob Dylan , Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger .

767867019_2584-3547	Accord and satisfaction is a settlement of an unliquidated debt . For example , a builder is contracted to build a homeowner a garage for $35,000 . The contract called for $17,500 prior to starting construction , to disburse $10,000 during various stages of construction , and to make a final payment of $7,500 at completion . At completion , the homeowner complained about inferior work quality and refused to make the final payment . After a mutual settlement agreement , the builder accepted $4,000 as full payment . Thereby , a new contract was formed by offer , acceptance , and consideration . The consideration is that for a $3,500 savings , the homeowner gives up that which he is entitled , a well - constructed garage . The builder gives up his right to full price to avoid suit for inferior performance . When accord and settlement has occurred , the homeowner and builder have given up his right to sue for more money under this settlement agreement .	Accord and satisfaction
826429959_942-1525	Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called `` composite volcanoes '' because of their composite layered structure built up from sequential outpourings of eruptive materials . They are among the most common types of volcanoes , in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes . Two famous stratovolcanoes are Krakatoa , best known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883 and Vesuvius , famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 CE . Both eruptions claimed thousands of lives . In modern times , Mount Saint Helens and Mount Pinatubo have erupted catastrophically .	Stratovolcano
826131604_44932-46153	Like many animals that evolved in isolation from significant predators , the dodo was entirely fearless of humans . This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors . Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships ' provisions , archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation . Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century , which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high , broken terrain . The human population on Mauritius ( an area of 1,860 km or 720 sq mi ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century , but they introduced other animals , including dogs , pigs , cats , rats , and crab - eating macaques , which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources . At the same time , humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos . The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population , especially the pigs and macaques , is today considered more severe than that of hunting . Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests , since dodos would have been used to dealing with local land crabs .	Dodo

825171915_343-1247	Bone marrow is a semi-solid tissue which may be found within the spongy or cancellous portions of bones . In birds and mammals , bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell production or hematopoiesis . It is composed of hematopoietic cells , marrow adipose tissue , and supportive stromal cells . On average , bone marrow constitutes 4 % of the total body mass of humans ; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass ( 143 lb ) , bone marrow typically accounts for approximately 2.6 kilograms ( 5.7 lb ) . Human marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day , which join the systemic circulation via permeable vasculature sinusoids within the medullary cavity .

826032032_134-1210	The United States presidential line of succession is the order in which persons may become or act as President of the United States if the incumbent president becomes incapacitated , dies , resigns , or is removed from office ( by impeachment by the House of Representatives and subsequent conviction by the Senate ) . The line of succession is set by the United States Constitution and the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 as subsequently amended to include newly created cabinet offices . The succession follows the order of vice president , Speaker of the House of Representatives , President pro tempore of the Senate , and then the heads of federal executive departments who form the Cabinet of the United States . The Cabinet currently has fifteen members , beginning with the Secretary of State , and followed by the rest in the order of their positions ' creation . Those heads of department who are ineligible to act as president are also ineligible to succeed the president by succession , for example most commonly if they are not a natural - born U.S. citizen .

827055466_1207-2017	La Niña is the positive phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation and is associated with cooler - than - average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean . However , each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a La Niña event , which is tailored to their specific interests . For example , the Australian Bureau of Meteorology looks at the trade winds , SOI , weather models and sea surface temperatures in the Niño 3 and 3.4 regions before declaring that a La Niña event has started . However , the Japan Meteorological Agency declares that a La Niña event has started when the average five - month sea surface temperature deviation for the NINO. 3 region is more than 0.5 ° C ( 0.90 ° F ) cooler for 6 consecutive months or longer .

It defines geodetic latitude 90 ° North , as well as the direction of true north . At the North Pole all directions point south ; all lines of longitude converge there , so its longitude can be defined as any degree value . Along tight latitude circles , counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west . The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere .	North Pole
833195046_11364-12241	Principal photography took place in the United Kingdom . The beach scenes were predominantly filmed in Pembrokeshire , on the Marloes Sands beach near the village of Marloes between September 26 and 29 , 2011 . Though the beach was not closed to the public during filming , as filming progressed , certain parts were advised to be off limits . A computer - generated castle was set on nearby Gateholm island . A field above the beach was used for production purposes , and a special wooden ramp was built for vehicles and horses to access the beach . The film used academic consultants from the University of Chichester and the University of Oxford for back - up research on fairy tales and medieval battles . The English band Florence and the Machine recorded `` Breath of Life '' exclusively for the film , which was reportedly inspired by Theron 's character Queen Ravenna .	Snow White and the Huntsman
793978230_992-1660	Sperm movement is activated by changes in intracellular ion concentration . The changes in ion concentration that provoke motility are different among species . In marine invertebrates and sea urchins , the rise in pH to about 7.2 -- 7.6 activates ATPase which leads to a decrease in intracellular potassium , and thus induces membrane hyperpolarization . As a result , sperm movement is activated . The change in cell volume which alters intracellular ion concentration can also contribute to the activation of sperm motility . In some mammals , sperm motility is activated by increase in pH , calcium ion and cAMP , yet it is suppressed by low pH in the epididymis .	Sperm motility
800869209_855-2044	The lunar phase or phase of the moon is the shape of the illuminated ( sunlit ) portion of the Moon as seen by an observer on Earth . The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth , according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth . The Moon 's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth 's gravity , therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth . This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit . Therefore , the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100 % ( full moon ) to 0 % ( new moon ) . The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres . Each of the four `` intermediate '' lunar phases ( see below ) is roughly seven days ( ~ 7.4 days ) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon 's orbit . Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker , all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight , followed by 14.77 days of `` night '' . ( The side of the Moon facing away from the Earth is sometimes called the `` dark side of the Moon '' , although that is a misnomer . )	Lunar phase
825339826_513-1639	The `` veil of ignorance '' is a method of determining the morality of political issues proposed in 1971 by American philosopher John Rawls in his `` original position '' political philosophy . It is based upon the following thought experiment : people making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents , abilities , tastes , social class , and positions they will have within a social order . When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights , positions , and resources in the society in which they will live , this `` veil of ignorance '' prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights , positions , and resources in that society . For example , for a proposed society in which 50 % of the population is kept in slavery , it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50 % likelihood that the participant would be a slave . The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations , since they will not be able to make choices based on their own self - or class - interest .

833713127_1740-2683	The Spirit of Ecstasy , also called `` Emily '' , `` Silver Lady '' or `` Flying Lady '' , was designed by English sculptor Charles Robinson Sykes , a graduate of London 's Royal College of Art , and carries with it a story about secret passion between Montagu , second Baron Montagu of Beaulieu after 1905 , a pioneer of the automobile movement , and editor of The Car Illustrated magazine from 1902 , and the model for the emblem , Eleanor Velasco Thornton . Eleanor ( also known as Thorn ) was the secretary of John Walter , who fell in love with her in 1902 when she worked for him on the aforesaid motoring magazine . Their secret love was to remain hidden , limited to their circle of friends , for more than a decade . The reason for the secrecy was Eleanor 's impoverished social and economic status , which was an obstacle to their love . On the other hand , Montagu was married to Lady Cecil Victoria Constance Kerr since 1889 . Side	Spirit of Ecstasy

826253702_3594-4682	The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers . It is governed by the presidentially appointed Board of Governors or Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ) . Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks , located in cities throughout the nation , oversee the privately owned U.S. member banks . Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their region , which entitles them to elect some of their board members . The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) sets monetary policy ; it consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents , though only five bank presidents vote at any given time : the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one - year terms . There are also various advisory councils . Thus , the Federal Reserve System has both public and private components . The structure is considered unique among central banks . It is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury , an entity outside of the central bank , prints the currency used .	Federal Reserve System

853149797_3294-4551	A proto - oncogene is a normal gene that could become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression . Proto - oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate the cell growth and differentiation . Proto - oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals , usually through their protein products . Upon acquiring an activating mutation , a proto - oncogene becomes a tumor - inducing agent , an oncogene . Examples of proto - oncogenes include RAS , WNT , MYC , ERK , and TRK . The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt 's lymphoma , which starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene . The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors . When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed , these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates . Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr - Abl gene found on the Philadelphia chromosome , a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22 . Bcr - Abl codes for a tyrosine kinase , which is constitutively active , leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation . ( More information about the Philadelphia Chromosome below )	Oncogene
807182788_343-1133	An irrigation tank or tank is an artificial reservoir of any size . They are mainly found in India . ( The word sagar refers to a large lake , usually man - made ) . It can also have a natural or man - made spring included as part of a structure . Tanks are part of an ancient tradition of harvesting and preserving the local rainfall and water from streams and rivers for later use , primarily for agriculture and drinking water , but also for sacred bathing and ritual . Often a tank was constructed across a slope so to collect and store water by taking advantage of local mounds and depressions . Tank use is especially critical in parts of South India without perennial rainfall where water supply replenishment is dependent on a cycle of dry seasons alternating with monsoon seasons .

832726718_4435-5248	The genetic mechanism behind human skin color is mainly regulated by the enzyme tyrosinase , which creates the color of the skin , eyes , and hair shades . Differences in skin color are also attributed to differences in size and distribution of melanosomes in the skin . Melanocytes produce two types of melanin . The most common form of biological melanin is eumelanin , a brown - black polymer of dihydroxyindole carboxylic acids , and their reduced forms . Most are derived from the amino acid tyrosine . Eumelanin is found in hair , areola , and skin , and the hair colors gray , black , blond , and brown . In humans , it is more abundant in people with dark skin . Pheomelanin , a pink to red hue is found in particularly large quantities in red hair , the lips , nipples , glans of the penis , and vagina .	Human skin color
835604412_18615-19797	With respect to its colonies , British mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth , to the exclusion of other empires . The government protected its merchants -- and kept others out -- through trade barriers , regulations , and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm . The government had to fight smuggling , which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French , Spanish , or Dutch . The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses , so that gold and silver would pour into London . The government took its share through duties and taxes , with the remainder going to merchants in Britain . The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy , which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires , and sometimes seized them . Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam ( New York ) in 1664 . The colonies were captive markets for British industry , and the goal was to enrich the mother country .	Mercantilism

834188205_1272-2165	The Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) ( Pub. L. 104 -- 199 , 110 Stat. 2419 , enacted September 21 , 1996 , 1 U.S.C. § 7 and 28 U.S.C. § 1738C ) was a United States federal law that , prior to being ruled unconstitutional , defined marriage for federal purposes as the union of one man and one woman , and allowed states to refuse to recognize same - sex marriages granted under the laws of other states . Until Section 3 of the Act was struck down in 2013 ( United States v. Windsor ) , DOMA , in conjunction with other statutes , had barred same - sex married couples from being recognized as `` spouses '' for purposes of federal laws , effectively barring them from receiving federal marriage benefits . DOMA 's passage did not prevent individual states from recognizing same - sex marriage , but it imposed constraints on the benefits received by all legally married same - sex couples .

'' In it , Omalu called for further study of the disease : `` We herein report the first documented case of long - term neurodegenerative changes in a retired professional NFL player consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) . This case draws attention to a disease that remains inadequately studied in the cohort of professional football players , with unknown true prevalence rates . '' Omalu believed the National Football League ( NFL ) doctors would be `` pleased '' to read it and that his research could be used to `` fix the problem . '' The paper received little attention initially , but members of the NFL 's Mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( MTBI ) Committee later called for its retraction in May 2006 . Their letter requesting the retraction characterized Omalu 's description of CTE as `` completely wrong '' and called the paper `` a failure . ''	Bennet Omalu

822761895_4563-6129	The phrase `` presidential pardon '' in that ceremony was apparently inserted by a speechwriter ; Bush initially was indifferent to the terminology , saying `` ' Reprieve , ' ' keep him going , ' or ' pardon ' : it 's all the same for the turkey , as long as he does n't end up on the president 's holiday table . '' Since then , at least one of the turkeys presented to the President has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life . For many years the turkeys were sent to Frying Pan Farm Park in Fairfax County , Virginia . From 2005 to 2009 , the pardoned turkeys were sent to either the Disneyland Resort in California or the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida , where they served as the honorary grand marshals of Disney 's Thanksgiving Day Parade . In 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , the turkeys were sent to live at Mount Vernon , the estate and home of George Washington ; Mount Vernon stopped displaying and accepting the turkeys due to the fact that they violated the estate 's policy of maintaining its own historical accuracy ( Washington never farmed turkeys ) . The 2013 , 2014 and 2015 turkeys were sent to Morven Park in Leesburg , Virginia , the estate of former Virginia governor ( and prolific turkey farmer ) Westmoreland Davis . Virginia Polytechnic Institute housed the 2016 pardoned turkey as well as the 2017 turkeys ; Virginia Tech was chosen because of the college 's poultry science program , and the National Turkey Federation wanted to begin a tradition of cooperation between the turkey industry and universities .

827733959_14189-15109	NPN is one of the two types of bipolar transistors , consisting of a layer of P - doped semiconductor ( the `` base '' ) between two N - doped layers . A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current . That is , when there is a positive potential difference measured from the base of an NPN transistor to its emitter ( that is , when the base is high relative to the emitter ) , as well as a positive potential difference measured from the collector to the emitter , the transistor becomes active . In this `` on '' state , current flows from the collector to the emitter of the transistor . Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P - type base region . To allow for greater current and faster operation , most bipolar transistors used today are NPN because electron mobility is higher than hole mobility .	Bipolar junction transistor
813934834_132-982	`` As a dog returns to his vomit , so a fool repeats his folly '' is an aphorism which appears in the Book of Proverbs in the Bible -- Proverbs 26 : 11 ( Hebrew : כְּ֭כֶלֶב שָׁ֣ב עַל ־ קֵאֹ֑ו כְּ֝סִ֗יל שֹׁונֶ֥ה בְאִוַּלְתֹּֽו ‎ Kəḵeleḇ šāḇ ' al - qê'ōw ; kəsîl , šōwneh ḇə'iwwaltōw . ) , also partially quoted in the New Testament , 2 Peter 2 : 22 . It means that fools are stubbornly inflexible and this is illustrated with the repulsive simile of the dog that eats its vomit again , even though this may be poisonous . Dogs were considered unclean in Biblical times as they were commonly scavengers of the dead and they appear in the Bible as repugnant creatures , symbolising evil . The reference to vomit indicates excessive indulgence and so also symbolises revulsion .	As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly
855533381_6015-7676	Louis Pasteur was unable to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a pathogen too small to be detected using a microscope . In 1884 , the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter ( known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur - Chamberland filter ) with pores smaller than bacteria . Thus , he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them . In 1892 , the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus . His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration . Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria , but did not pursue the idea . At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium -- this was part of the germ theory of disease . In 1898 , the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent . He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing , but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles , he called it a contagium vivum fluidum ( soluble living germ ) and re-introduced the word virus . Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature , a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley , who proved they were particulate . In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus -- agent of foot - and - mouth disease ( aphthovirus ) -- through a similar filter .	Virus

865617413_318-1096	In linguistics , and particularly phonology , stress or accent is relative emphasis or prominence given to a certain syllable in a word , or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence . This emphasis is typically caused by such properties as increased loudness and vowel length , full articulation of the vowel , and changes in pitch . The terms stress and accent are often used synonymously in this context , but they are sometimes distinguished . For example , when emphasis is produced through pitch alone , it is called pitch accent , and when produced through length alone , it is called quantitative accent . When caused by a combination of various intensified properties , it is called stress accent or dynamic accent ; English uses what is called variable stress accent .	Stress (linguistics)

833398293_3819-4781	In association football , or soccer , a player 's height may somewhat determine the position that they play ; however , people of all heights have an equal opportunity to excel professionally at the sport . Goalkeepers , centre backs and `` target '' heading forwards tend to be taller , while players in wide and attacking positions tend to be shorter . A study of the greatest male players in history showed that the distribution of heights approximated the average man and , when also looking at the typical weight distribution , an estimated 95 % of the world 's population would fall into the body type distribution of great footballers . A sample of reasonably select players from ages 11 -- 18 in the United States tended to approximate the height distribution of the population . However , there is an overwhelming tendency for the 11-most picked players in a squad to be shorter than their teammates , which could suggest a bias in the scouting system .	Height in sports

The next in line , Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman , is the son of King Salman , and thus from the ruling House of Saud . The king - appointed cabinet includes more members of the royal family . The monarchy was hereditary by agnatic seniority until 2006 , when a royal decree provided that future Saudi kings are to be elected by a committee of Saudi princes .

805209466_756-1902	When he comes ashore , he is captured by a giant farmer , who perceives Gulliver only as an animal , a freak of nature resembling a man - shaped mouse . He takes Gulliver home and gives him to his nine - year - old daughter , a child `` not above forty feet high , being little for her age . '' She makes Gulliver her pet , creates a small travel case for him ( a miniature bed - chamber in a box ) , and is amused to play with him as if he were a doll . Gulliver grows very fond of the girl , and gives her the pet name of Glumdalclitch , or `` little nurse '' in the Brobdingian language . ( Of course `` little '' is highly ironic considering the circumstances . If Gulliver knows her real name , he does not tell the reader . ) Glumdalclitch is a skilled seamstress with a talent for making dolls ' clothes . Although Gulliver admires the wardrobe that she makes for him , he finds that even the finest Brodingnagian fabric is coarse and irritates his skin . The farmer takes Gulliver about as a freak show , charging observers money for performances . Gulliver grows very proud of the stunts that he performs for Glumdalclitch 's amusement .	Glumdalclitch
861932655_1604-2568	The source of Marley 's inspiration for the lyrics of `` Three Little Birds '' remains disputed . They are partly inspired by birds that Marley was fond of , that used to fly and sit next to his home . Tony Gilbert , a long time friend of Marley , was present at the time he was writing the song and elaborated , `` Bob got inspired by a lot of things around him , he observed life . I remember the three little birds . They were pretty birds , canaries , who would come by the windowsill at Hope Road . '' However , three female singers from the reggae group I Threes who did shows with Marley claim it is a reference to them . I Threes member Marcia Griffiths remarked , `` After the song was written , Bob would always refer to us as the Three Little Birds . After a show , there would be an encore , sometimes people even wanted us to go back onstage four times . Bob would still want to go back and he would say , ' What is my Three Little Birds saying ?

866495254_32126-33980	Defence Against the Dark Arts , commonly shortened to D.A.D.A. , is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts , and to be protected from Dark creatures . In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , with Death - Eaters in charge of the school , the subject is renamed the Dark Arts , and involves pupils practicing the Cruciatus Curse on those who have earned detentions . The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members -- throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year . Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject . During the period the story takes place , the class is taught by Quirinus Quirrell ( book one ) , Gilderoy Lockhart ( book two ) , Remus Lupin ( book three ) , Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor `` Mad - eye '' Moody ( book four ) , Dolores Umbridge ( book five ) , Severus Snape ( book six ) , and Amycus Carrow ( book seven ) . Hagrid suggests in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets that `` They 're startin ' ter think the job 's jinxed . No one 's lasted long for a while now . '' In Half - Blood Prince , Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected . The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling . The position had also been coveted by Snape , but he was denied the position as well . Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half - Blood Prince . Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died , the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue , set nineteen years afterwards . Furthermore , she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to the class to give lectures on the subject .	Magic in Harry Potter
807039939_6640-7777	The first phase within interphase , from the end of the previous M phase until the beginning of DNA synthesis , is called G ( G indicating gap ) . It is also called the growth phase . During this phase , the biosynthetic activities of the cell , which are considerably slowed down during M phase , resume at a high rate . The duration of G is highly variable , even among different cells of the same species . In this phase , the cell increases its supply of proteins , increases the number of organelles ( such as mitochondria , ribosomes ) , and grows in size . In G phase , a cell has three options . ( 1 ) To continue cell cycle and enter S phase ( 2 ) Stop cell cycle and enter G phase for undergoing differentiation. ( 3 ) Get arrested in G phase hence it may enter G phase or re-enter cell cycle . The deciding factor is availability of nitrogens and storage of energy rich compounds at the deciding point called check point . This check point is called the restriction point or START and is regulated by G / S cyclins , which cause transition from G to S phase . Passage through the G check point commits the cell to division . S	Cell cycle
807039939_375-1540	The cell cycle or cell - division cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA ( DNA replication ) to produce two daughter cells . In bacteria , which lack a cell nucleus , the cell cycle is divided into the B , C , and D periods . The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication . DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells . In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for a big cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . During the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells . To ensure the proper division of the cell , there are control mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints. This helps the cell produce even more	Cell cycle
827309646_3468-4417	The Pike Place Fish Market is best known for their habit of hurling customers ' orders across the shopping area . A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish , with their fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots calling out the order , which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff , at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer 's fish behind the counter for wrapping . Initially , the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee , but was enjoyed by customers , so it became a tradition . While working , the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish . At times , the fish market staff will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders , or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss . Above the areas in which they throw fish , the market hangs a sign that reads , `` Caution : Low Flying Fish '' .	Pike Place Fish Market
810606599_22105-23085	Most manufacturers , and almost all in Europe , designate their pencils with the letters H ( commonly interpreted as `` hardness '' ) to B ( commonly `` blackness '' ) , as well as F ( usually taken to mean `` fineness '' , although F pencils are no more fine or more easily sharpened than any other grade . also known as `` firm '' in Japan ) . The standard writing pencil is graded HB . This designation might have been first used in the early 20th century by Brookman , an English pencil maker . It used B for black and H for hard ; a pencil 's grade was described by a sequence or successive Hs or Bs such as BB and BBB for successively softer leads , and HH and HHH for successively harder ones . The Koh - i - Noor Hardtmuth pencil manufacturers claim to have first used the HB designations , with H standing for Hardtmuth , B for the company 's location of Budějovice , and F for Franz Hardtmuth , who was responsible for technological improvements in pencil manufacture .

862159990_16257-17382	The most common marine fish in the Sound include porgy , butterfish , winter flounder , summer flounder , windowpane flounder , fourspot flounder , northern and striped sea robin , little skate , menhaden , Atlantic silversides , black seabass , blackfish ( tautog ) , cunner , bluefish , and smooth dogfish . Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore , both members of the tuna family , enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore . Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing . Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare , small local populations . Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous . Anadromous fishes include striped bass , white perch , alewives , blueback herring , and American and hickory shad . Although several shark species likely infrequently wander in and out of the Sound , e.g. blue shark , mako shark , hammerhead shark & thresher shark , there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area . These are the sand tiger shark , the sandbar shark , the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish . Mollusks	Long Island Sound

Their bodies are normally squatting , with their arms resting in different positions and are without legs . The majority of the ahu are found along the coast and face inland towards the community . There are some inland ahu such as Ahu Akivi . These moai face the community but given the small size of the island , also appear to face the coast . Eyes	Moai
846064090_8257-8858	The statues were carved by the Polynesian colonizers of the island , mostly between circa 1250 A.D. and 1500 A.D. In addition to representing deceased ancestors , the moai , once they were erected on ahu , may also have been regarded as the embodiment of powerful living or former chiefs and important lineage status symbols . Each moai presented a status : `` The larger the statue placed upon an ahu , the more mana the chief who commissioned it had . '' The competition for grandest statue was ever prevalent in the culture of the Easter Islanders . The proof stems from the varying sizes of moai .	Moai
812067029_960-2145	The Townshend Acts were a series of British acts passed beginning in 1767 and relating to the British American colonies in North America . The acts are named after Charles Townshend , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , who proposed the program . Historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading `` Townshend Acts '' , but five acts are often mentioned : The Revenue Act of 1776 , the Indemnity Act ( 1776 ) , the Commissioners of Customs Act ( 1767 ) , the Vice Admiralty Court Act ( 1777 ) , and the New York Restraining Act ( 1776 . ) . The purpose of the Townshend Acts was to raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain , to create a more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations , to punish the province of New York for failing to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act , and to establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies . The Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) were met with resistance in the colonies , prompting the occupation of Boston by British troops in 1768 , which eventually resulted in the Boston Massacre of 1770 .

865719407_5017-6018	Out of all the water on Earth , saline water in oceans , seas and saline groundwater make up about 97 % of it . Only 2.5 -- 2.75 % is fresh water , including 1.75 -- 2 % frozen in glaciers , ice and snow , 0.5 -- 0.75 % as fresh groundwater and soil moisture , and less than 0.01 % of it as surface water in lakes , swamps and rivers . Freshwater lakes contain about 87 % of this fresh surface water , including 29 % in the African Great Lakes , 22 % in Lake Baikal in Russia , 21 % in the North American Great Lakes , and 14 % in other lakes . Swamps have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers , most notably the Amazon River . The atmosphere contains 0.04 % water . In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface , fresh water derived from precipitation may , because of its lower density , overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers . Most of the world 's fresh water is frozen in ice sheets . Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water , such as deserts .	Fresh water
797382264_1800-2307	The name of Segovia is of Celtiberian origin . The first inhabitants named the city Segobriga . This name comes from two terms of the Celtiberian language of the Celtic branch of Indo - European . The term Sego means `` victory '' ( the prefix is also present in other city names such as Segeda and Segontia , cf . German `` Sieg '' or Dutch `` zege '' ) and the suffix - briga would mean `` city '' or `` strength '' . So the name might be translated as `` City of the victory '' or `` Victorious city '' .

808092246_8707-9766	The security of HTTPS is that of the underlying TLS , which typically uses long - term public and private keys to generate a short - term session key , which is then used to encrypt the data flow between client and server . X. 509 certificates are used to authenticate the server ( and sometimes the client as well ) . As a consequence , certificate authorities and public key certificates are necessary to verify the relation between the certificate and its owner , as well as to generate , sign , and administer the validity of certificates . While this can be more beneficial than verifying the identities via a web of trust , the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures drew attention to certificate authorities as a potential weak point allowing man - in - the - middle attacks . An important property in this context is forward secrecy , which ensures that encrypted communications recorded in the past can not be retrieved and decrypted should long - term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future . Not all web servers provide forward secrecy .	HTTPS
853892092_20618-21972	Lake Michigan is home to a wide variety of fish species and other organisms . It was originally home to lake whitefish , lake trout , yellow perch , panfish , largemouth bass , smallmouth bass and bowfin , as well as some species of catfish . As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919 , an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting , there has been a decline in native lake trout populations , ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species , the alewife . As a result , salmonids , including various strains of brown trout , steelhead ( rainbow trout ) , coho and chinook salmon , were introduced as predators in order to decrease the alewife population . This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded , resulting in the creation of a large sport fishery for these introduced species . Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead , brown trout , and coho and chinook salmon , which have also begun natural reproduction in some Lake Michigan tributaries . However , several introduced invasive species , such as lampreys , round goby , zebra mussels and quagga mussels , continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility , resulting in knock - on changes to Lake Michigan 's ecosystem , threatening the vitality of native fish populations .

804155181_2194-3153	The Governor General of Canada ( French : Gouverneure générale du Canada ) is the federal viceregal representative of the Canadian monarch , currently Queen Elizabeth II . The person of the sovereign is shared equally both with the 15 other Commonwealth realms and the 10 provinces of Canada , but resides predominantly in her oldest realm , the United Kingdom . Because of this , the Queen , on the advice of her Canadian prime minister , appoints a governor general to carry out most of her constitutional and ceremonial duties . The commission is for an unfixed period of time -- known as serving at Her Majesty 's pleasure -- though five years is the normal convention . Beginning in 1959 , it has also been traditional to rotate between anglophone and francophone incumbents -- although many recent governors general have been bilingual . Once in office , the governor general maintains direct contact with the Queen , wherever she may be at the time .	Governor General of Canada

826581678_736-1831	Alkaloids are produced by a large variety of organisms including bacteria , fungi , plants , and animals . They can be purified from crude extracts of these organisms by acid - base extraction . Alkaloids have a wide range of pharmacological activities including antimalarial ( e.g. quinine ) , antiasthma ( e.g. ephedrine ) , anticancer ( e.g. homoharringtonine ) , cholinomimetic ( e.g. galantamine ) , vasodilatory ( e.g. vincamine ) , antiarrhythmic ( e.g. quinidine ) , analgesic ( e.g. morphine ) , antibacterial ( e.g. chelerythrine ) , and antihyperglycemic activities ( e.g. piperine ) . Many have found use in traditional or modern medicine , or as starting points for drug discovery . Other alkaloids possess psychotropic ( e.g. psilocin ) and stimulant activities ( e.g. cocaine , caffeine , nicotine , theobromine ) , and have been used in entheogenic rituals or as recreational drugs . Alkaloids can be toxic too ( e.g. atropine , tubocurarine ) . Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals , they almost uniformly evoke a bitter taste .

828434659_2810-4068	Charles City is known for the role it played in the history of the American tractor . A native son Charles Walter Hart , whose father owned three local farms , met Charles H. Parr in college . After graduating from the University of Wisconsin , Hart and Parr developed a two - cylinder gasoline engine and set up their Hart - Parr Gasoline Engine Company in Charles City in 1897 . It was here in 1901 the term `` tractor '' with Latin roots and a combination of the words traction and power was first coined by Hart and Parr . In 1903 the firm built fifteen `` tractors '' , the first successful production - model tractor line in the U.S. The 14,000 pound No. 3 is the oldest surviving internal combustion engine tractor in the United States and is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. In 1929 , Hart - Parr was one of the four companies that merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company and finally the White Farm - New Idea Equipment Co . At its peak in the mid-1970s , the sprawling plant complex encompassed 23 acres and employed nearly 3,000 workers . The 1980s farm crisis and other economic pressures led to the closing of the plant in 1993 . As of 2013 , the vacant site stands ready for re-use . HART	Charles City, Iowa
842633568_960-2295	The world 's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng ( 990 -- 1051 ) . Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 Johannes Gutenberg , introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years .	Movable type
836778170_838-1766	A motorist approaching an all - way stop is always required to come to a full stop before the crosswalk or stop line . In most jurisdictions that use all - way stops , pedestrians always have priority at a crosswalk , even if the crosswalk is not delineated with pavement markings . Within some U.S. jurisdictions , such as the state of Idaho , bicyclists are exempt from the need to make a complete stop , but must give way to other vehicles as otherwise required by law . After a full - stop has been made , vehicles usually have the right - of - way to proceed through the intersection in the order that they arrived at the intersection . In the United States , if vehicles arrive at approximately the same time , each driver must yield to the drivers on their right . Some areas have additional formal and informal rules which may or may not include special procedures for when all stop signs are approached simultaneously .	All-way stop
817117472_2244-3094	In economics , tax incidence or tax burden is the analysis of the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare . The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product , which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers . The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats , in particular François Quesnay , who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent . Tax incidence is said to `` fall '' upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of , or ultimately has to pay , the tax . The key concept is that the tax incidence or tax burden does not depend on where the revenue is collected , but on the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply .	Tax incidence
856058031_5884-7025	In the Canadian Forces , sappers exist both in the regular force and reserve force . The rank of sapper is used instead of private trained to signify completion of the Engineer DP1 course . Canadian sappers have been deployed in many major conflicts in recent history including World War I , World War II , the Korean War , and the War in Afghanistan . The roles of a sapper entail : Bridge building with the ACROW , Bailey , or Medium Girder Bridge bridging systems ; explosive ordnance disposal ; operating the advanced reverse - osmosis water purification unit , used mainly in domestic operations ; maintaining roadways and airfields ; combat diving ; tactical breaching ; and erecting and tearing down friendly living spaces . Ultimately , the objective of the sappers is to facilitate the living , moving , and fighting for friendly troops on the battlefield , and denying the same to enemy forces . The motto of the Canadian Military Engineers is Ubique ( Latin : everywhere ) a motto shared with the Royal Canadian Artillery . The patron saint of combat engineers is Saint Barbara , and 4 December is the corps ' day of celebration .	Sapper
797207220_303-1301	The term goes back to the early 1900s , and is alleged to have originated when a ship run by British officers and a Chinese crew practiced a fire drill for a fire in the engine room . The bucket brigade drew water from the starboard side , took it to the engine room , and poured it onto the ' fire ' . To prevent flooding , a separate crew hauled the accumulated water from the engine room , up to the main deck and heaved the water over the port side . The drill had previously gone according to plan until the orders became confused in translation . The bucket brigade began to draw the water from the starboard side , run over to the port side and then throw the water overboard , bypassing the engine room completely . Additionally , the term is documented to have been used in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II , where it was often expressed in the phrase `` as screwed up as a Chinese fire drill '' . It was also commonly used by Americans during the Korean War and the Vietnam War .	Chinese fire drill

847822566_1076-1901	The original inspiration was a romantic encounter that producer David A. Stewart of Eurythmics had with Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac . On The Howard Stern Show , Stewart explained that the title 's phrase was actually uttered by Nicks . She had broken up with Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh the night before , and invited Stewart to her place for a party after an early Eurythmics show in Los Angeles . Stewart did not know who she was at the time , but went anyway . When the partygoers all disappeared to a bathroom for a couple of hours to snort cocaine , he decided to go upstairs to bed . He woke up at 5am to find Nicks in his room trying on Victorian clothing and described the entire scenario as very much reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland . Later that morning , she told Walsh , `` Do n't come around here no more . ''	Don't Come Around Here No More
803403924_308-1105	The exact etymology of the nickname is unknown , but most folklore believe its roots come from the fact that tar , pitch , and turpentine created from the vast pine forests were some of North Carolina 's most important exports early in the state 's history . For a time after the American Civil War , the name Tar Heel was derogatory , but it was later reappropriated by the people of North Carolina . Because the exact history of the term is unknown , a number of legends have developed to explain it . One such legend claims it to be a nickname given during the U.S. Civil War , because of the state 's importance on the Confederate side , and the fact that the troops `` stuck to their ranks like they had tar on their heels '' . The term `` Tar Heel '' gained popularity during the Civil War .	Tar Heel
856780829_914-1658	Truman told Congress that `` it must be the policy of the United States to support free people who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures . '' Truman claims that because totalitarian regimes coerced free peoples , they automatically represented a threat to international peace and the national security of the United States . Truman made the plea in the midst of the Greek Civil War ( 1946 -- 49 ) . He argued that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid , they would inevitably fall to communism with grave consequences throughout the region . Because Turkey and Greece were historic rivals , it was considered necessary to help both equally even though the crisis in Greece was far more intense .	Truman Doctrine

815214581_9034-9888	On September 20 , both the Baltimore Patriot and The American printed the song , with the note `` Tune : Anacreon in Heaven '' . The song quickly became popular , with seventeen newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire printing it . Soon after , Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title `` The Star Spangled Banner '' , although it was originally called `` Defence of Fort M'Henry '' . Thomas Carr 's arrangement introduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from `` The Anacreontic Song '' . The song 's popularity increased and its first public performance took place in October when Baltimore actor Ferdinand Durang sang it at Captain McCauley 's tavern . Washington Irving , then editor of the Analectic Magazine in Philadelphia , reprinted the song in November 1814 .	The Star-Spangled Banner
801295479_16856-18009	Ballard realized that looking for the wreck itself using sonar was unlikely to be successful and adopted a different tactic , drawing on the experience of the surveys of Thresher and Scorpion ; he would look for the debris field instead , using Argo 's cameras rather than sonar . Whereas sonar could not distinguish man - made debris on the sea bed from natural objects , cameras could . The debris field would also be a far bigger target , stretching a mile ( 1.6 km ) or longer , whereas Titanic itself was only 90 feet ( 27 m ) wide . The search required round - the - clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed , with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris . After a week of fruitless searching , at 12.48 am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorr 's screens . One of them was identified as a boiler , identical to those shown in pictures from 1911 . The following day , the main part of the wreck was found and Argo sent back the first pictures of Titanic since her sinking 73 years before . The discovery made headlines around the world .

804622010_2184-3139	The Byzantine Empire , also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire , was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages , when its capital city was Constantinople ( modern - day Istanbul , which had been founded as Byzantium ) . It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural , and military force in Europe . Both `` Byzantine Empire '' and `` Eastern Roman Empire '' are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire ( Greek : Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων , tr . Basileia tôn Rhōmaiōn ; Latin : Imperium Romanum ) , or Romania ( Ῥωμανία ) , and to themselves as `` Romans '' .	Byzantine Empire

804844335_497-1050	The Molasses Act of March 1733 was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain ( citation 6 Geo II . c. 13 ) , which imposed a tax of six pence per gallon on imports of molasses from non-English colonies . Parliament created the act largely at the insistence of large plantation owners in the British West Indies . The Act was not passed for the purpose of raising revenue , but rather to regulate trade by making British products cheaper than those from the French West Indies . The Molasses Act greatly affected the significant colonial molasses trade .	Molasses Act
835662174_51264-52193	In early 2017 , Variety reported that Fremantle Media was in talks to revive the show for NBC or for its original network , Fox . A dispute between Fremantle and Core Media Group derailed these plans . Then , in May 2017 , it was announced that ABC was making a bid to revive the program . Later , ABC announced that it had acquired the rights to the series , and that American Idol would return for the 2017 -- 18 television season . On May 16 , Katy Perry was the first judge to be announced by ABC . On July 20 , 2017 , it was announced on Live with Kelly and Ryan , that Ryan Seacrest would be returning as the host for the revival season . On September 24 , 2017 , Luke Bryan was the second judge to be announced for the revival season . On September 29 , 2017 , Lionel Richie was the third and final judge to be announced . On November 6 , 2017 , it was announced that the revival season would premiere on March 11 , 2018 .	American Idol
864864565_14339-15037	On August 27 , 1664 , while England and the Dutch Republic were at peace , four English frigates sailed into New Amsterdam 's harbor and demanded New Netherland 's surrender , whereupon New Netherland was provisionally ceded by Stuyvesant . On September 6 , Stuyvesant sent lawyer Johannes de Decker and five other delegates to sign the official Articles of Capitulation . This was swiftly followed by the Second Anglo - Dutch War , between England and the Dutch Republic . In June 1665 , New Amsterdam was reincorporated under English law as New York City , named after the Duke of York ( later King James II ) . He was the brother of the English King Charles II , who had been granted the lands .	New Amsterdam
819278435_5737-7268	Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains motion sensors within the fluids . At the base of each canal , the bony region of the canal is enlarged which opens into the utricle and has a dilated sac at one end called the osseous ampullae . Within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris . These hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula . As the head rotates the duct moves but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia . This deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within . The bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain . Within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion , the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected , stopping the sensation of acceleration . The specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph . Consequently , the cupula is not displaced by gravity , unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule . As with macular hair cells , hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium . Deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition . In the horizontal canal , ampullopetal flow is necessary for hair - cell stimulation , whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary in the anterior and posterior canals .	Semicircular canals
804476497_2954-3719	Escaping from town , Jamie cowers in a pick - up truck as Rachel hits Michael head on , throwing him off the road and knocking him out . Despite Rachel 's orders , Jamie goes over to him and holds his hand . The police tell Jamie to drop to the ground and shoot Michael many times , causing him to fall into an abandoned mine shaft , which then collapses on top of him . Later , back in her foster home , Jamie is possessed by Michael 's spirit and stabs her foster mother , though not fatally . When screams are heard from upstairs , Dr. Loomis walks over to the staircase seeing Jamie poised at the top holding a pair of bloody scissors . Sheriff Ben Meeker ( Beau Starr ) restrains Loomis from shooting her . Jamie is now apparently consumed by Michael 's rage .	Jamie Lloyd
840183282_96-1572	The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3 % of its GDP , due to the influence of its vast oil resources . The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped , leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically , such as salt or iron ore . Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria , which grants titles to organizations to explore , mine , and sell mineral resources . Organized mining began in 1903 when the Mineral Survey of the Northern Protectorates was created by the British colonial government . A year later , the Mineral Survey of the Southern Protectorates was founded . By the 1940s , Nigeria was a major producer of tin , columbite , and coal . The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Mining regulation is handled by the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development , which oversees the management of all mineral resources . Mining law is codified in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries . The Obasanjo administration began a process of selling off government - owned corporations to private investors in 1999 .

856526612_2279-3259	In February 1933 , three men were arrested who were to play pivotal roles during the Leipzig Trial , known also as the `` Reichstag Fire Trial '' : Bulgarians Georgi Dimitrov , Vasil Tanev and Blagoy Popov . The Bulgarians were known to the Prussian police as senior Comintern operatives , but the police had no idea how senior they were : Dimitrov was head of all Comintern operations in Western Europe . The responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains an ongoing topic of debate and research . Historians disagree as to whether van der Lubbe acted alone , as he said , to protest the condition of the German working class . The Nazis accused the Comintern of the act . Some historians endorse the theory , initially proposed by the Communist Party , that the arson was planned and ordered by the Nazis as a false flag operation . The building remained in its fire - damaged state until it was partially repaired from 1961 to 1964 , then completely restored from 1995 to 1999 .	Reichstag fire
866449443_46666-48226	Diana 's bulletproof bracelets were formed from the remnants of Athena 's legendary shield , the Aegis , to be awarded to her champion . The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she - goat , Amalthea , who suckled Zeus as an infant . These forearm guards have thus far proven indestructible and able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks , allowing Wonder Woman to deflect automatic weapon fire and energy blasts . Diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like Superman 's ears bleed . Recently , she gained the ability to channel Zeus 's lightning through her bracelets as well . Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation , because they were once part of the Aegis , and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use . After the 2011 relaunch of the character , it was revealed that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she had inherited from Zeus in check . In addition , Hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow Wonder Woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet . Each sword , marked with a red star , takes shape from a flash of lightning , and when Wonder Woman is done with them , the swords disappear , supposedly , back into her bracelets . As such , she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows , spears and energy bolts among others .	Wonder Woman
836794862_714-1443	A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language . In other words , it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language . The linguistics field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology . A morpheme is not identical to a word , and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone , whereas a word , by definition , is freestanding . When a morpheme stands by itself , it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own ( e.g. the morpheme cat ) and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea , it is an affix because it has a grammatical function ( e.g. the -- s in cats to indicate that it is plural ) . Every word comprises one or more morphemes .	Morpheme
815914800_27432-28455	The NCAA has never officially recognized a national champion from among the bowl coalition institutions , but in 2004 the NCAA commissioned Jeff Sagarin to use his computer model to retroactively determine the highest ranked teams for the years prior to the BCS . His champion for the 1950 season is Kentucky . The polls for the 1950 national champion , taken before the bowl games were played , list either Oklahoma ( AP , Berryman , Helms , Litkenhous , UPI , Williamson ) , Princeton ( Boand , Poling ) , or Tennessee ( Billingsley , DeVold , Dunkel , Missouri , Don Faurot Football Research , National Championship Foundation , Sagarin ( ELO - Chess ) ) . Tennessee was the winner of the Cotton Bowl and the only team to beat Kentucky during the 1950 season . Oklahoma was named National Champion by AP and UPI Coaches ' Poll , both which awarded their titles before the bowl games . Kentucky would go on to beat Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl . However , they are still not recognized as national champions for that year .	Kentucky Wildcats football

' Feast of the Sacrifice ' ‎ , ( ʕiːd ælˈʔɑdʕħæː ) ) , also called the `` Sacrifice Feast '' , is the second of two Muslim holidays celebrated worldwide each year , and considered the holier of the two . It honors the willingness of Ibrahim ( Abraham ) to sacrifice his son , as an act of obedience to God 's command . Before Abraham sacrificed his son , God provided a male goat to sacrifice instead . In commemoration of this , an animal is sacrificed and divided into three parts : one third of the share is given to the poor and needy ; another third is given to relatives , friends and neighbors ; and the remaining third is retained by the family .

799861066_3352-4764	Unlike per capita GDP or standard of living , both of which can be measured in financial terms , it is harder to make objective or long - term measurements of the quality of life experienced by nations or other groups of people . Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well - being : Emotional well - being , in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiences -- the frequency and intensity of their experiences of , for example , joy , stress , sadness , anger , and affection -- and life evaluation , in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale . Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time . Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity . There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care , wealth and materialistic goods . However , it is much more difficult to measure meaningful expression of one 's desires . One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals . Quality of life can simply mean happiness , the subjective state of mind . By using that mentality , citizens of a developing country appreciate more since they are content with the basic necessities of health care , education and child protection .	Quality of life

( However , the advice was often ignored ; the Council still carried out her wishes . ) Routine administration was usually left to the Council . It was involved in matters of religion , military , the queen 's security , economics , and the welfare of the citizens . It dealt with both matters of national and individual interest , issued proclamations in the queen 's name , and supervised law and enforcement .	Elizabethan government
843088128_12848-13788	Historically , the constellations can be simply divided into two regions ; namely the northern and southern sky , whose origins are distinctly different . The northern skies have constellations that have mostly survived since Antiquity , whose common names are based on Classical Greek legends or those whose true origins have now been lost . Evidence of these constellations have survived in the form of star charts , whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the Farnese Atlas , which has been suggested to be based on the star catalogue of the Greek astronomer , Hipparchus . Southern hemisphere constellations are more modern inventions , which were created as new constellations , or become substitutes for some ancient constellation . e.g. Argo Navis . Some southern constellations were to become obsolete or had extended names that became foreshortened to more usable forms e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca .	Constellation
842365745_2097-3511	Players who are not drafted in a league 's annual draft of amateur players are considered to be unrestricted free agents and are free to sign contracts with any team . In most North American professional sports , players are drafted by sequencing each team from worst to best ( according to the teams ' immediately preceding season record , sometimes invoking a draft lottery factor to avoid having teams intentionally lose their last games to gain higher draft position ) and allowing said teams to claim rights to the top players entering the league that year . Players that pass through an entire draft ( usually several rounds ) without being selected by any of the league 's teams become unrestricted free agents , and these players are sometimes identified simply as an undrafted free agent ( UDFA ) or undrafted sportsperson and are free to sign with any team they choose . The term `` undrafted free agent '' is most common in the National Football League , where rookies enter directly into the NFL and do not play in a minor league system . It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League , which increasingly uses college hockey as a source ; the NHL Entry Draft usually drafts players during high school age ( i.e. , junior leagues ) , which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL .

822159927_64585-66528	In `` New Guys '' , Andy returns from Outward Bound manager training , making him become more `` decisive and confident '' . When Andy tells Toby that he plans to fabricate an excuse to fire Nellie , Toby shoots down the idea as a violation of corporate policy , prompting Andy to tell Toby `` I understand why Michael did n't like you . '' When Andy hosts a motivational exercise involving a tightrope , he insults Toby and Nellie in front of the staff . Since that time , Andy has been rude towards Toby in a manner that echoes Michael Scott 's hatred of his harmless HR rep , though Toby seems much less affected by Andy 's behavior than he was by Michael 's . When Andy went off on his long boat trip , Toby 's time in the last season was devoted to his unrequited romantic interest in Nellie Bertram and his belief that he 'd convicted an innocent man during his jury time on the Scranton Strangler case ( a theory he put to rest when he went to visit the convict in prison and was , in fact , strangled and nearly killed by him ) . In the series finale , it 's revealed that Toby was fired immediately after Dwight fired Kevin Malone ( it 's likely that the Corporate office fired Toby and Dwight simply had the burden of telling him ) and Toby then moved to New York where he 's trying to become a novelist and has six roommates . Toby surprises his former co-workers at the reunion panel when he says that his life feels meaningless now that he 's not being filmed for the documentary anymore . He breaks down in tears while dancing with Pam at Dwight and Angela 's wedding , saying of what 's bad in his life that `` It 's everything ! '' , but he seems cheered a little when the group insists he join them for post-wedding festivities . In a photo gallery NBC released of `` where are they now ?

834324633_11142-12231	In their original contracts for the first season , cast members were paid $22,500 per episode . The cast members received different salaries in the second season , beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode . Before their salary negotiations for the third season , the cast decided to enter collective negotiations , despite Warner Bros . ' preference for individual deals . The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member , meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced . The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three , $85,000 in season four , $100,000 in season five , $125,000 in season six , $750,000 in seasons seven and eight , and $1 million in seasons nine and ten , making Aniston , Cox , and Kudrow the highest - paid TV actresses of all time . The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations . At the time , that financial benefit of a piece of the show 's lucrative back - end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show , like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby .

798882302_30341-31191	For the second season , the city of Dubrovnik , Croatia , was used instead of Malta for scenes in King 's Landing and Daenerys ' scenes in Qarth . For example , the Minčeta Tower in Dubrovnik was used as the House of the Undying . Scenes set north of the Wall were filmed in Iceland in November 2011 . The main locations are the Vatnajökull glacier , the Svínafellsjökull glacier near Skaftafell , and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier near Vik used as the location for the Fist of the First Men with Höfðabrekka as the Frostfang Mountains . New shooting locations in Northern Ireland include The Linen Mill Film & Television Studios in Banbridge , Ballintoy Harbour and Downhill Strand .

854736235_3126-4025	The role of the Emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler . Since the establishment of the first shogunate in 1199 , the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander , unlike many Western monarchs . Japanese Emperors have nearly always been controlled by external political forces , to varying degrees . In fact , between 1192 and 1867 , the shōguns , or their shikken regents in Kamakura ( 1203 -- 1333 ) , were the de facto rulers of Japan , although they were nominally appointed by the Emperor . After the Meiji Restoration in 1867 , the Emperor was the embodiment of all sovereign power in the realm , as enshrined in the Meiji Constitution of 1889 . Since the enactment of the 1947 Constitution , he has been a ceremonial head of state without even nominal political powers .	Emperor of Japan
834247650_6191-7400	In the season premiere , Hale is first seen moving into the office of the chief , a position that he states will soon be official . His brother , Jacob , apologizes for bringing Zobelle to Charming , and states that he never intended things to escalate as far as they did . Jacob also tells Hale that he is continuing with his campaign to be mayor of Charming , and asks for `` the support of the chief . '' Hale agrees to support his brother . Later in the episode , Hale keeps vigil over Half - Sack 's funeral which is being attended by numerous Sons Of Anarchy members and associates . Jacob meets him there and reiterates his disgust for the gang and the apparent outpouring of support for them . Hale explains that people , including those in Charming , do n't like to see SAMCRO vulnerable since it makes everyone uncomfortable . Later into the funeral , an unknown party , later revealed to be the Calaveras MC , commits a drive - by shooting , injuring and killing several attendees . Hale tries to stop them by getting in front of their van and firing at the driver , but is killed when the vehicle runs him over .

813917407_5398-6100	The discovery of the neutron in 1932 revealed that atomic nuclei were made of protons and neutrons , held together by an attractive force . By 1935 the nuclear force was conceived to be transmitted by particles called mesons . This theoretical development included a description of the Yukawa potential , an early example of a nuclear potential . Mesons , predicted by theory , were discovered experimentally in 1947 . By the 1970s , the quark model had been developed , by which the mesons and nucleons were viewed as composed of quarks and gluons . By this new model , the nuclear force , resulting from the exchange of mesons between neighboring nucleons , is a residual effect of the strong force .	Nuclear force
804584219_1750-3448	The eighth named storm , third hurricane , and the first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles , reaching tropical storm status on August 17 . The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day , passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August 20 . The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west - northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucatán Peninsula , before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23 . Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24 , regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day . While the storm moved generally northwest , Harvey 's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24 -- 25 ; however , Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day . Hours later , Harvey made landfall near Rockport , Texas , at peak intensity . Afterwards , rapid weakening ensued , and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state , dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state . On August 28 , it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico , strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29 . As Harvey drifted inland , it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1 , before dissipating two days later .	Hurricane Harvey
843336103_197-1325	Unlike most Western countries , 18 of the U.S. states do not have a legal minimum age of marriage . Individuals aged 18 have the ability to marry in U.S. states except Nebraska ( 19 ) and Mississippi ( 21 ) . In addition , all states , except Delaware and New Jersey , allow minors to marry in certain circumstances , such as parental consent , judicial consent , pregnancy , or a combination of these situations . Most states allow parties aged 16 and 17 to marry with parental consent alone . In most states , children under 16 can be married too . In the 32 states which have an absolute minimum age set by statute , this age varies between 14 and 18 , while in 18 states there is no statutory minimum age if other legal conditions are met . Although in such states there is no set minimum age by statute , the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls - ages which have been confirmed by case law in some states . Over the past 15 years , more than 200,000 minors married in US , and in Tennessee girls as young as 10 were married in 2001 , before the state finally set a minimum age of 17 in 2018 .

854125397_1137-2107	The territory of Siberia extends eastwards from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between the Pacific and Arctic drainage basins . The Yenisei River conditionally divides Siberia into two parts , Western and Eastern . Siberia stretches southwards from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north - central Kazakhstan and to the national borders of Mongolia and China . With an area of 13.1 million square kilometres ( 5,100,000 sq mi ) , Siberia accounts for 77 % of Russia 's land area , but it is home to approximately 36 million people -- 27 % of the country 's population . This is equivalent to an average population density of about 3 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 7.8 / sq mi ) ( approximately equal to that of Australia ) , making Siberia one of the most sparsely populated regions on Earth . If it were a country by itself , it would still be the largest country in area , but in population it would be the world 's 35th - largest and Asia 's 14th - largest .	Siberia
817961878_1378-2282	The growing commerce between America and China , the presence of American whalers in waters off Japan , and the increasing monopolization of potential coaling stations by the British and French in Asia were all contributing factors in the decision by President Fillmore to dispatch an expedition to Japan . The Americans were also driven by concepts of Manifest Destiny and the desire to impose the benefits of western civilization and the Christian religion on what they perceived as `` backward '' Asian nations . By the early nineteenth century , the Japanese policy of isolation was increasingly under challenge . In 1844 , King William II of the Netherlands sent a letter urging Japan to end the isolation policy on its own before change would be forced from the outside . Between 1790 and 1853 at least twenty - seven U.S. ships ( including three warships ) visited Japan , only to be turned away .	Perry Expedition
831641516_692-1283	Diagnosis is often challenging , because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific . For example , redness of the skin ( erythema ) , by itself , is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong . Thus differential diagnosis , in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted , must be performed . This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns . Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom ( or a group of several ) that is pathognomonic .	Medical diagnosis
800498401_182-996	`` Out of left field '' is American slang meaning `` unexpectedly '' , `` odd '' or `` strange '' .

797649934_2683-3856	Social exchange theory goes back to Thibaut and Kelley ( 1959 ) , Kelley and Thibaut ( 1978 ) , Homans ( 1961 ) and Rusbult ( 1983 ) . Sociologist George Homans published a work `` Social Behavior as Exchange '' . He defined social exchange as the exchange of activity , tangible or intangible , and more or less rewarding or costly , between at least two persons . After Homans founded the theory , other theorists continued to write about it , particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson , who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology . Homans ' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another . Although there are various modes of exchange , Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange . John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts , the dyad and small group . Lévi - Strauss is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange , such as kinship systems and gift exchange .

857007246_9046-10212	Casting was problematic . Richard Pryor was Brooks ' original choice to play the Sheriff Bart , but the studio , claiming his history of drug arrests made him uninsurable , refused to approve financing with Pryor as the star . Cleavon Little was cast in the role , and Pryor remained as a writer . Brooks offered the other leading role , the Waco Kid , to John Wayne ; he declined , deeming the film `` too blue '' for his family - oriented image , but assured Brooks that `` he would be the first one in line to see it . '' Gig Young was cast , but he collapsed during his first scene from what was later determined to be alcohol withdrawal syndrome , and Gene Wilder was flown in to replace him . Johnny Carson and Wilder both turned down the Hedley Lamarr role before Harvey Korman was cast . Madeline Kahn objected when Brooks asked to see her legs during her audition . `` She said , ' So it 's THAT kind of an audition ? ' '' Brooks recalled . `` I explained that I was a happily married man and that I needed someone who could straddle a chair with her legs like Marlene Dietrich in Destry Rides Again . So she lifted her skirt and said , ' No touching . ' ''	Blazing Saddles

856261503_135-1187	The Committee of Public Safety ( French : Comité de salut public ) -- created in April 1793 by the National Convention and then restructured in July 1793 -- formed the de facto executive government in France during the Reign of Terror ( 1793 -- 94 ) , a stage of the French Revolution . The Committee of Public Safety succeeded the previous Committee of General Defence ( established in January 1793 ) and assumed its role of protecting the newly established republic against foreign attacks and internal rebellion . As a wartime measure , the Committee -- composed at first of nine , and later of twelve , members -- was given broad supervisory powers over military , judicial , and legislative efforts . It was formed as an administrative body to supervise and expedite the work of the executive bodies of the Convention and of the government ministers appointed by the Convention . As the Committee tried to meet the dangers of a coalition of European nations and counter-revolutionary forces within the country , it became more and more powerful .	Committee of Public Safety
852181193_2710-3801	The Delaware River rises in two main branches that descend from the western flank of the Catskill Mountains in New York . The West Branch begins near Mount Jefferson in the Town of Jefferson in Schoharie County . The river 's East Branch begins at Grand Gorge near Roxbury in Delaware County . These two branches flow west and merge near Hancock in Delaware County , and the combined waters flow as the Delaware River south . Through its course , the Delaware River forms the boundaries between Pennsylvania and New York , the entire boundary between New Jersey and Pennsylvania , and most of the boundary between Delaware and New Jersey . The river meets tide - water at the junction of Morrisville , Pennsylvania , and Trenton , New Jersey , at the Falls of the Delaware . The river 's navigable , tidal section served as a conduit for shipping and transportation that aided the development of the industrial cities of Trenton , Camden , and Philadelphia . The mean freshwater discharge of the Delaware River into the estuary of Delaware Bay is 11,550 cubic feet per second ( 327 m / s ) .	Delaware River
826713020_21300-22103	The BLM has established Herd Management Areas to determine where and how many animals will be sustained as free - roaming populations . Some populations of free - roaming horses and burros remain protected under the Act , but others have disappeared from places where there were once established populations . A few hundred free - roaming horses survive in Alberta and British Columbia . The BLM considers roughly 26,000 individuals a manageable number , but the feral mustang population in February 2010 was 33,700 horses and 4,700 burros . More than half of all mustangs in North America are found in Nevada ( which features the horses on its State Quarter ) , with other significant populations in California , Oregon , Utah , Montana , and Wyoming . Another 34,000 horses are in holding facilities .	Mustang
821812832_1916-2639	The Roman month Februarius was named after the Latin term februum , which means purification , via the purification ritual Februa held on February 15 ( full moon ) in the old lunar Roman calendar . January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar , since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period . They were added by Numa Pompilius about 713 BC . February remained the last month of the calendar year until the time of the decemvirs ( c. 450 BC ) , when it became the second month . At certain intervals February was truncated to 23 or 24 days , and a 27 - day intercalary month , Intercalaris , was inserted immediately after February to realign the year with the seasons .

812597704_1909-2708	In the Northern Hemisphere , the sun path near to the winter solstice ( November , December , January ) rises in the southeast , transits the celestial meridian at a low angle in the south ( more than 43 ° above the southern horizon in the tropics ) , and then sets in the southwest . It is on the south ( equator ) side of the house all day long . A vertical window facing south ( equator side ) is effective for capturing solar thermal energy . For comparison , the sun path near the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere ( May , June , July ) rises in the northeast , peaks out at a low angle in the north ( more than halfway up from the horizon in the tropics ) , and then sets in the northwest . There , the north - facing window would let in plenty of solar thermal energy to the house .	Sun path

779299207_1321-2121	Gabriel Okara 's poem consists of 10 stanzas and describes the interplay of different interpretations of the same sounds , sights , and dances . The interaction that takes place within the poem is commonly thought to be between a white colonialist and an African native . The poem follows a trope in African literature of `` The White Man Laughed '' , which embodies the notion of dismay and cynical derision of the beliefs , practices , and norms of an African . However , Okara 's poem can be seen to transcend the acceptance of the derision of the White Man and present a wiser African intellectual . The poem concludes with the African teaching the White Man of his ignorance and helping him realize that the native beliefs of the African are not primitive nor removed from intellectual thought .

826375490_3518-4701	Marble Falls is located in southern Burnet County at 30 ° 34 ′ N 98 ° 17 ′ W ﻿ / ﻿ 30.567 ° N 98.283 ° W ﻿ / 30.567 ; - 98.283 ( 30.5741 , - 98.2782 ) , on the banks of Lake Marble Falls . According to the Handbook of Texas website , the former falls were flooded by the lake , which was created by a shelf of limestone running diagonally across the Colorado River from northeast to southwest . The upper layer of limestone , brownish on the exterior but a deep blue inside , was so hard and cherty it was mistaken for marble . The falls were actually three distinct formations at the head of a canyon 1.25 miles ( 2.01 km ) long , with a drop of some 50 feet ( 15 m ) through the limestone strata . The natural lake and waterfall were covered when the Colorado River was dammed with the completion of Max Starcke Dam in 1951 . A photo of the falls as they once existed can be seen at the website for the Wallace Guest House , a local bed and breakfast . Lake Marble Falls sits between Lake Lyndon B. Johnson to the north and Lake Travis to the south . The falls for which the city is named are now underwater but are revealed every few years when the lake is lowered .	Marble Falls, Texas
809874177_3832-4534	When the war ended , I do n't know if I was more relieved that we 'd won or that I did n't have to go back . Passchendaele was a disastrous battle -- thousands and thousands of young lives were lost . It makes me angry . Earlier this year , I went back to Ypres to shake the hand of Charles Kuentz , Germany 's only surviving veteran from the war . It was emotional . He is 107 . We 've had 87 years to think what war is . To me , it 's a licence to go out and murder . Why should the British government call me up and take me out to a battlefield to shoot a man I never knew , whose language I could n't speak ? All those lives lost for a war finished over a table . Now what is the sense in that ? --	Harry Patch
